<p>The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.visitbritain.com/"><b>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</b></a> (the <i>United Kingdom</i> or the <i>UK</i>) is a constitutional monarchy comprising most of the <a href="/wiki/Britain_and_Ireland" title="Britain and Ireland">British Isles</a>.</p>
<p>The Union comprises four constituent nations: <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>, <a href="/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wales" title="Wales">Wales</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. It occupies all of the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern portion of the island of Ireland and most of the remaining British Isles. It is important to remember that the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland" title="Republic of Ireland" class="mw-redirect">Republic of Ireland</a> is a completely separate country to the United Kingdom, having seceded from the Union and gained its independence in 1922. The <a href="/wiki/Isle_of_Man" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a> and the various <a href="/wiki/Channel_Islands" title="Channel Islands">Channel Islands</a> are "crown dependencies", governing themselves by their own legislatures with Crown assent. These dependencies are not part of the United Kingdom, nor of the EU, but neither are they completely sovereign nations in their own right either. The UK has <a href="/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>, <a href="/wiki/Belgium" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> as its nearest neighbours.</p>
<p>The 'Great' in Great Britain (<i>Grande-Bretagne</i> in French) is to distinguish it from the other, smaller "Britain": <a href="/wiki/Brittany" title="Brittany">Brittany</a> (<i>Bretagne</i>) in northwestern <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>.</p>
<p>The UK today is a diverse patchwork of native and immigrant cultures, possessing a fascinating history and dynamic modern culture, both of which remain hugely influential in the wider world. Although Britannia no longer rules the waves, the UK is still a popular destination for many travellers. The capital and largest city of the United Kingdom is <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>.</p>

<p>Geographically, "Great Britain" ("GB") refers just to the largest island; that is, Scotland, England, and Wales together. Great Britain became part of the United Kingdom when the Irish and British parliaments merged in 1801 to form the "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland". This was changed to "... and Northern Ireland" when all but the six Northern Irish counties seceded from the Union in 1922 after a treaty granting Irish home rule. "Britain" is simply another name for the United Kingdom, and does include Northern Ireland, despite <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://digitaldiplomacy.fco.gov.uk/en/guidance/content/editorial/style/uk-britain">common misconception otherwise</a>.</p>
<p>The <b>Union Flag</b> of the United Kingdom is popularly known as the <b>Union Jack</b>, even on land. It comprises the flags of Saint George of England, Saint Andrew of Scotland and the Saint Patrick's Cross of Ireland superimposed on each other. Within England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, the flags of each nation are commonly used. The Saint Patrick's Cross flag is often seen on Saint Patrick's Day in Northern Ireland. Since the Republic of Ireland split from the UK though, Saint Patrick's Saltire is not used for Northern Ireland, as it represented the whole of the island of Ireland. A flag (known as the "Ulster Banner") was designed for Northern Ireland in the 1920s, which was based on the flag of Ulster (similar in appearance to the St. George's Cross flag of England) and includes a Red Hand of Ulster and a crown. Although the flag's official status ended with the dissolving of the province's devolved government in the early 1970s, it can still be seen in Northern Ireland, particularly among the Protestant community and on sporting occasions. As Wales was politically integrated into the English kingdom hundreds of years ago, its flag was not incorporated into the Union Jack. The flag features a red dragon on a green field.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Crown_Dependencies">Crown Dependencies</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Crown Dependencies">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>The <b>Isle of Man</b> and the <b>Channel Islands</b> are not strictly part of the UK, but rather are 'Crown Dependencies: they have their own democratic governments, laws and courts and are not part of the EU. They are not entirely sovereign either, falling under the British Crown which chooses to have its UK Government manage some of the islands' affairs. The people are British Citizens, but unless they have direct ties with the UK, through a parent, or have lived there for at least 5 years, they are not able to take up work or residence elsewhere in the European Union.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Overseas_Territories_and_the_Commonwealth">Overseas Territories and the Commonwealth</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: Overseas Territories and the Commonwealth">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Again, these are not constitutionally part of the United Kingdom, but are largely former colonies of the British Empire which are to varying degrees, self-governing entities that still recognise the British Monarch as their head of state. The key difference is residents of Overseas Territories still possess British citizenship, where as those of Commonwealth nations do not, and are subject to the same entry and immigration rules as non-EU citizens.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Referring_to_nationality">Referring to nationality</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: Referring to nationality">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>Don't describe citizens of the United Kingdom as "English". The Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish do not identify themselves as being from "England". If you need to refer to someone's nationality, you can use the most precise term, 'English', 'Northern Irish', 'Welsh' or 'Scottish'. To play safe, you can ask someone from which part of the UK they are from, as this covers every corner of the isles - including Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Northern Ireland and Scotland can be particularly sensitive, and 'Scottish', 'Northern Irish', 'Irish', or 'British' can all be appropriate according to the political persuasion of the individual. Irish nationalists may avoid referring to Northern Ireland at all, referring instead to 'The Six Counties' or 'The North', or talk about 'Ireland' as a whole. 'Northern Irish' is less likely to offend, whereas referring to someone from Northern Ireland as 'British' or as 'Irish' can cause offence depending on a person's political ideology.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that, while technically a county of England, the issue of identity in <a href="/wiki/Cornwall" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> is very sensitive among some people. It is best to refer to anyone you meet in Cornwall as Cornish, unless they have already explicitly stated their identity as English.</p>
<p>As a visitor from outside the UK, you are unlikely to cause serious offence. At worst, you will incur a minor rebuff and reaffirmation of their nationality, as in "I'm not English. I'm Scottish".</p>

<p>The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with the Queen as the nominal head of state (now just a figure head). It has a bicameral parliament: The lower house, known as the House of Commons, is popularly elected by the people and is responsible for proposing new laws. The upper house, known as the House of Lords, primarily scrutinises and amends bills proposed by the lower house. The House of Lords is not elected and consists of Hereditary Peers, whose membership is guaranteed by birth right, Life Peers, who are appointed to it by the Queen, and the Lords Spiritual, who are bishops of the Church of England. The Head of Government is the Prime Minister, who is usually the leader of the majority party in the House of Commons. It has a first-past-the post system divided into local constituencies. In practice, the Prime Minister wields the most authority in government, with the Queen being pretty much a figurehead, though all bills that have been passed in both houses of parliament require the Queen to grant royal assent (which in theory, she has the right to refuse) before they become law.</p>
<p>Additionally, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have their own elected bodies (the Northern Ireland Assembly, Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly). These devolved governments have a First Minister and varying degrees of power over matters internal to that constituent country, including the passing of laws. For example, the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh exercises power and passes laws over almost every matter internal to Scotland. In the areas over which it has power, the UK government plays no role. As a result, institutions and systems can be radically different between the four constituent countries in the UK. England has no similar body of its own, with all government coming from Westminster.</p>
<p>There are also local government authorities responsible for services at a local level. Each constituency votes for a local MP (Member of Parliament) who then goes to sit in Parliament and debate and vote - whether they do or not is another matter.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Using_maps_and_postcodes">Using maps and postcodes</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7" title="Edit section: Using maps and postcodes">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Most basic mapping in the United Kingdom is undertaken by the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/">Ordnance Survey of Great Britain</a> (OSGB) and the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.osni.gov.uk/">Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland</a>. The maps found in bookshops may be published directly by those organisations, or by private map publishers drawing on basic Ordnance Survey data.</p>
<p>One consequence of this for the traveller is the widespread use of Ordnance Survey grid references in guide books and other information sources. These are usually presented in the format of two capital letters followed by a 6 digit number ( eg: SU921206) and form a quick way of finding any location on a map. If using a GPS be sure to set it to the British National Grid (BNG) and the OSGB datum.</p>
<p>The Ordnance Survey's 1:50,000 or 1:25,000 scale maps are astonishingly detailed and show contour lines, public rights of way, and access land. For pursuits such as walking, they are practically indispensable, and in rural areas show individual farm buildings and (on the larger scale) field boundaries.</p>
<p>Another company, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.harveymaps.co.uk/index.html">Harvey Maps</a>, produces specialist maps for outdoor activities including walking, climbing and mountain biking. These are surveyed independently of OSGB although they use the same grid reference system. They cover only a selection of popular locations. They have some advantages over the OSGB maps: they are printed on waterproof material, they are scaled according to the requirements of the activity and location (up to 1:12500 for complex mountain areas), and they contain less distracting detail not relevant to the specific activities for which they are designed.</p>
<p>The UK is also covered by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> although coverage varies considerably.</p>
<p>Every postal address has a postcode, either a unique one or one shared with its immediate neighbours. British postcodes take the form <b>(AAnn nAA)</b>, where AA is 2 or 1 letters representing the town, city or geographic area immediately followed by a 1 or 2 digit number <i>nn</i> representing the district, a space, then one digit and 2 letters <i>nAA</i> which denotes about 30 delivery points. In built-up areas this will be part of a road and even a specific section or floor of a building on that road. Therefore, a postcode will identify a location to within a few tens of metres in urban locations; and adding a house number will usually identify a property uniquely (at road junctions two houses with the same number may share the same postcode). Most internet mapping services enable locations to be found by postcode. Owing to London's huge size and population it has its own distinct variation of the postcode system where the town code AA is replaced by an area code indicating the geographic part of the city - e.g. N=North, WC=West Central, EC=East Central, SW=South West; and so on.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Climate">Climate</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Climate">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>The UK has a benign humid-temperate climate moderated by the North Atlantic current and the country's proximity to the sea. Warm, damp summers and mild winters provide temperatures pleasant enough to engage in outdoor activities all year round. Having said that, the weather in the UK can be changeable and conditions are often windy and wet. British rain is world renowned, but in practice it rarely rains more than two or three hours at a time and often parts of the country stay dry for many weeks at a time, especially in the East. More common are overcast or partly cloudy skies. It is a good idea to be prepared for a change of weather when going out; a jumper and a raincoat usually suffice when it is not winter. In summer temperatures can reach 30º in parts and in winter temperatures may be mild, i.e. 10º in southern Britain and -10º in Scotland.</p>
<p>Because the UK stretches nearly a thousand kilometres from end to end, temperatures can vary quite considerably between north and south. Differences in rainfall are also pronounced between the drier east and wetter west. Scotland and north-western England (particularly the Lake District) are often rainy and cold. Alpine conditions with heavy snowfall are common in the mountains of northern Scotland during the winter. The north-east and Midlands are also cool, though with less rainfall. The south-east and east Anglia are generally warm and dry, and the south-west warm but often wet. Wales and Northern Ireland tend to experience cool to mild temperatures and moderate rainfall, while the hills of Wales occasionally experience heavy snowfall. Even though the highest land in the UK rarely reaches more than 1300 metres, the effect of height on rainfall and temperature is great.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bank_.28public.29_holidays">Bank (public) holidays</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Bank (public) holidays">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Each country (and sometimes cities, such as Glasgow and Edinburgh) within the UK have a number of (slightly differing) public holidays, on which the majority of people do not work. Shops, pubs, restaurants and similar are usually open. Many UK residents will take advantage of the time off to travel, both within the UK and abroad. This makes transport links busier than usual and tends to increase prices. If your travel dates are flexible you may wish to avoid travelling to or from the UK on bank holiday weekends.</p>
<p>The following 8 bank holidays apply in all parts of the UK:</p>
<ul><li>New Year's Day (1 January)</li>
<li>Good Friday (the Friday immediately before Easter Sunday)</li>
<li>Easter Monday (the Monday immediately after Easter Sunday)</li>
<li>Early May Bank Holiday (the first Monday in May)</li>
<li>Spring Bank Holiday (the last Monday in May)</li>
<li>Summer Bank Holiday (the last Monday in August, except in Scotland where it is the first Monday in August)</li>
<li>Christmas Day (25 December)</li>
<li>Boxing Day (26 December)</li>
</ul><p>Northern Ireland has the following two additional bank holidays:</p>
<ul><li>St Patrick's Day (17 March)</li>
<li>Battle of the Boyne / Orangemen's Day (12 July)</li>
</ul><p>Scotland officially has two additional bank holidays:</p>
<ul><li>the day after New Year's Day (2 January)</li>
<li>St Andrew's Day (30 November)</li>
</ul><p>In practice, with the exception of Easter, Christmas and New Year holidays, UK bank holidays are virtually ignored in Scotland in favour of local holidays which vary from place to place.</p>
<p>Where a bank holiday falls on a Saturday or Sunday, it is moved to the following Monday. If both Christmas Day and Boxing Day fall on a weekend, the Boxing Day holiday is moved to the following Tuesday.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom is physically linked to two other countries. The Channel Tunnel connects the UK to <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a> and Northern Ireland shares a land border with the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland" title="Republic of Ireland" class="mw-redirect">Republic of Ireland</a>.</p>
<p>While the UK is a member of the European Union, it does not fully implement the <a href="/wiki/Europe#Get_around" title="Europe">Schengen Agreement</a>, which means that travel to and from other EU countries (except Ireland) involves systematic passport / identity card checks at the border and separate visa requirements for several countries.</p>
<p>Almost all passengers travelling to the UK from outside Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man go through systematic passport/identity card and selective customs checks carried out by the <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/">UK Border Agency</a></b> on arrival in the UK. However, those travelling by Eurostar from Paris Gare du Nord, Lille Europe, Calais-Fréthun and Brussels Zuid-Midi stations and by ferry from Calais and Dunkirk undergo UK passport/identity card checks in France/Belgium before embarkation and selective customs checks on arrival in the UK. Those entering the UK by Eurotunnel from France go through both UK passport/identity card and UK customs checks in Coquelles before boarding the train.</p>

<p><b>Common Travel Area</b></p>
<p>If you enter the United Kingdom through Ireland, you will pass through passport control at your port of entry into Ireland, but you are <b>not</b> required to clear UK passport control. However, you will only be limited to a stay of <b>three months</b> in the UK and Ireland (or whatever the passport control officer in Ireland gives you a leave to remain for) if you qualify for a visa exemption, <b>not</b> the usual six-month stay in the UK for visa-exempt nationals. Hence, especially if you attempt to enter the UK as a Student Visitor (i.e. a visitor studying for up to 6 months), you should <b>not</b> transit through Ireland unless you possess a valid UK visa or entry clearance permitting a stay of more than three months or intend to stay in the UK for fewer than three months.</p>
<p>If you require a visa for either Ireland or the UK, however, you <b>must possess a visa</b> from each country that requires you to have one if you intend to visit both of them. Not passing through passport control does not exempt one from having a visa if needed, and you can be fined and deported for not having a visa if discovered.</p>
<p>In addition, no passport control checks are in place from the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man to the UK.</p>

Once in the UK, they are not allowed to work or access public funds (e.g. claiming state benefits). If citizens of these countries/territories wish to stay in the UK for purposes other than a tourist, businessperson or student visitor (i.e. a visitor studying for up to 6 months) or wish to stay for more than 6 months in the UK, they will need to apply for an <b>entry clearance</b> (i.e. a visa) <i>before</i> travelling to the UK. Citizens of these countries/territories who do intend to stay in the UK as a student visitor should ensure that their passport is endorsed with a stamp with either the code 'VST' or 'STV' at passport control, otherwise the education provider where they intend to study may refuse to accept them for enrolment.</li>
</ul><ul><li>A visa is required for citizens of most other countries to enter the UK and a number of countries to transit the UK airside. This can be obtained from the British Embassy, High Commission or Consulate where the applicant legally resides. Unless they are 6 years old or under or travelling directly to the Channel Islands and not passing through the UK or the Isle of Man, UK visa applicants are required to provide biometric data (10-digit fingerprints and a biometric digital photograph) as part of the application process. As part of the visa application procedure, it is necessary to attend a UK visa application centre <i>in person</i> to provide your biometrics.</li>
</ul><ul><li>The United Kingdom has converted the previous visa categories (except for the visitor and transit categories) into a five-tiered points-based system (PBS), meaning that you will be required to satisfy specific and non-negotiable criteria before the visa is issued. Points-based system visa fees are <i>very</i> high, so it may be wise to see if the purpose of your visit can be satisfied under a different, non-points based system visa. For example, if you want to stay in the UK for 11 months to study an English Language course, it would be cheaper to apply for a student visitor visa (£140), rather than a Tier 4 student visa (£255).</li>
</ul><ul><li>Commonwealth citizens who are 17 or over and have a British grandparent (or Irish grandparent before April 1922) can apply for an <b>ancestry visa</b>. This allows residency and work in the UK for five years. After five years, permanent residence (indefinite leave to remain) may be applied for; after 12 months of continuous permanent residence and five years of continuous residence in the UK, ancestry visa holders will be able to apply for naturalisation as a British citizen. All Commonwealth citizens living in the UK (regardless of what type of visa they hold and whether they have a British grandparent) are eligible to vote in all elections.</li>

</ul><ul><li>Travellers subject to immigration control should expect to be asked by the immigration officer upon arrival to demonstrate that they have a) a return ticket to leave the United Kingdom or sufficient funds to meet the cost of an onwards plane ticket, b) a valid address at which they will be staying in the United Kingdom and c) sufficient funds with which to support themselves during their stay.

<ul><li>The United Kingdom is known to be somewhat more lax than some other countries when it comes to character concerns of visitors. Landing cards do not ask about prior convictions and border/ visa personnel seem to be more concerned about convictions <i>inside</i> the UK rather than those abroad. That said, if the border officer questions you about criminal history, you must answer truthfully.</li>
</ul><ul><li>If you're applying for a visa or entry clearance, you will have to list any criminal convictions as part of the application, although there are no hard and fast rules regarding who is admissible and who is not: each case is viewed on its own merits and a minor conviction long ago is unlikely to cause problems, especially if your behaviour since then has been good.</li>
</ul><ul><li>If you're applying for a visa, you are also required to disclose if you've ever:
<ul><li><b>Declared bankruptcy</b>, no matter how long ago.</li>
<li><b>Been sued for debt</b> (i.e. a civil judgement). This is true even if you've satisfied (paid) the judgement or it is no longer legally collectable.</li>
</ul><dl><dd>The UK Border Agency takes a dim view of both these situations, as there have been recent abuses of the UK banking and lending system by foreign visitors and immigrants, and unpaid debt or a bankruptcy abroad can be grounds for refusal. Like with criminality, each case is evaluated based on the totality of the circumstances and denial of entry or a visa for credit problems is very unlikely for visitors <i>unless</i> you owe money in the UK (see below).</dd>
</dl></li>
</ul><ul><li>If you have more than £1,000 of unpaid debt <u>in the UK</u>, that is not in good standing, you cannot be issued a visa or granted entry until the debt is paid or satisfactory arrangements are in place to pay it.</li>

<p>The UK has relatively strict laws controlling which goods can and cannot be brought into the country. Selective customs checks are run by the <b>UK Border Agency</b> at arrival ports. Particularly stringent laws apply to the movement of animals, except from within the EU, where an animal passport system operates, providing proof of vaccination against rabies. The British Isles are rabies-free, and the government (and the people) want to keep it that way. Signs in several languages are displayed prominently at even the smallest of boat landings all around the coast.</p>
<p>Owing to the abolition in 1993 of customs duty on goods for personal use when travelling across EU borders, it has become popular among the British to bring back large quantities of alcohol and tobacco bought at lower tax rates in Continental Europe. However, the practice is open to abuse, with organised criminals trying to illegally import large amounts for the purposes of selling on at a profit. Customs laws are therefore strict for the importing of alcohol and tobacco for non-personal use and if a Customs officer thinks that the amount you are trying to bring into the country from the EU is excessive, particularly if in a commercial vehicle as opposed to a private car, you may be questioned further, or be asked to prove that it is for your own consumption, although ultimately an EU citizen is backed by the EU's free trade laws and allowed unlimited personal quantities. The fines can be severe, and you also run the risk of the goods (and the vehicle they are being transported in) being confiscated. Importing an excessive amount of alcohol in a private car is more likely to result in action being taken for overloading the vehicle, which is a police matter rather than a customs matter.</p>
<p>Most ports of entry that receive traffic from non-EU origins use the European Union's red/green/blue channel system. Ports of entry from EU origins are still manned by customs officers who take more of an interest in controlled substances (e.g. illegal drugs) than alcohol or tobacco.</p>

Major airports and ferry routes</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>When flying to the UK you are most likely to arrive at one of London's five airports, although there are direct international flights to many other cities. KLM (now merged with Air France) has a large number of feeder flights from almost every UK regional airport to its international hub in Amsterdam Schiphol.</p>
<p>Recently, many airports in southern England have added "London" to their names. Be aware that just because an airport has London in its name <i>doesn't necessarily</i> mean that it is near to, or easily accessible from, London.</p>
<p>Inner/ more convenient airports to London:</p>
<ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/Heathrow_Airport" title="Heathrow Airport">London Heathrow Airport</a></b> is the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.heathrowairport.com/">world's busiest international airport</a>. Situated 15 miles (24 km) west of central London, Heathrow offers a large choice of international destinations, with direct flights to most countries in the world. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.british-airways.com/">British Airways</a> has its hub at Heathrow and offers a wide range of international flights to Europe, the Americas, Asia, Africa and Australia. There are fewer direct flights to South America, although many South American airlines connect to London via Spain and/or the Americas. Other large airlines operating at Heathrow include <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://virginatlantic.com/">Virgin Atlantic</a> and the main national airlines of most countries. Heathrow is badly laid out from a passenger's perspective, invariably involves a lot of walking even if you don't get lost, and is comprised of 5 terminals. There are <i>three</i> different Tube stops - so do find out which one you are departing from <i>before</i> going to the airport!</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Gatwick_Airport" title="Gatwick Airport">London Gatwick Airport</a></b> , 30 miles (50 km) south of London in Sussex, is the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.gatwickairport.com/">second-largest London airport</a>, and also offers a wide range of international flights. Air-Asia X is a budget long-haul airline, which has been expanding at Gatwick recently. It is important to note that the North and South terminal are some distance from each other, so check first which one you will flying from before arrival to avoid missing a flight if rushing or late.</li>
<li><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.londoncityairport.com/">London City Airport</a></b> is the most central airport in London, situated 7 miles east of Central London. It is easy to get to or Canary Wharf on the DLR line or via Black Cab. Due to the short runway and noise restrictions, the airport is restricted to small aircraft. As a result, service is more or less limited to UK domestic and Western European destinations - primarily financial centres such as Frankfurt, Madrid, Paris, Zurich, etc. British Airways does offer two daily all business class returns between New York-JFK and London City on a specially configured Airbus A318.</li>
</ul><p>Outer/ less convenient airports to London:</p>
<ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/London_Stansted_Airport" title="London Stansted Airport">London Stansted Airport</a></b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.stanstedairport.com/">[4]</a> in <a href="/wiki/Essex_(England)" title="Essex (England)">Essex</a> is the third busiest UK airport in a very swanky modern terminal designed by Norman Foster. It is the largest hub for the budget airlines Ryanair <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ryanair.com/">[5]</a> and also easyJet <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.easyjet.com/">[6]</a> who offer direct flights to a wide range of European and North African destinations as well as to Asia, with daily flights to Kuala Lumpur with Air Asia X. It's often cheaper to fly here but bear in mind it is about 40 miles/60 km outside Central London so always factor in extra travelling time. There is an express train service from Liverpool St, which takes 45?50 minutes, but easyBus is a cheaper (if longer, 2 hour) option.</li>
<li><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.london-luton.co.uk/">London Luton Airport</a></b> in <a href="/wiki/Bedfordshire" title="Bedfordshire">Bedfordshire</a> is a major hub for the orange wings of Stelios <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.easyjet.com/">[7]</a> (indeed easyJet featured in a long-running popular TV series based at the airport) and to a lesser extent, Ryanair <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ryanair.com/">[8]</a>. Luton can offer much cheaper flights then Heathrow or Gatwick, with other airlines such as Thomsons and WizzAir having over 10 destinations each too. Most flights are within the EU, though some Near Eastern routes are served, such as Tel Aviv, Egypt and Dubai. Luton is not as far out as Stanstead and it is possible to take cheap suburban (First Capital Connect) trains from its Parkway Airport station to London terminals.</li>
<li><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.southendairport.com/">London Southend Airport</a></b> in <a href="/wiki/Essex_(England)" title="Essex (England)">Essex</a> is 55 mins by train from London Liverpool Street station (a station on this line is next door to the terminal building) and 44 minutes from London Stratford station. It serves as a hub for easyJet, Aer Arann and Jet2.com.</li>
</ul><p>Major airports outside of the London area:</p>
<ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/Manchester_Airport" title="Manchester Airport">Manchester Airport</a></b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/">[9]</a> in the North of England is the UK's largest airport outside London, serving many European and a reasonable number of long-haul destinations. This could be a more convenient arrival airport for visitors to North Wales, the North of England and Scotland.</li>
</ul><p>Outside London and Manchester, many of the regional airports offer a wide range of direct links to European and some long-haul destinations.</p>
<ul><li><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.bhx.co.uk/">Birmingham International</a></b> is one of the UK's largest airports outside of London. The airport has good European services and some long haul services to far flung places. The airport is served by the major European flag carriers providing global hub connections, as well as LCC's such as Ryanair and Easyjet. It is an ideal gateway to Central England and Wales. Birmingham Airport also has a direct train route to London Euston (journey times approximately 75 minutes on the fastest trains) and is a hub for the low cost airline <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://flybe.com">FlyBe</a>.</li>
</ul><ul><li><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.liverpoolairport.com/">Liverpool John Lennon Airport</a></b>, in North West England, is the UK's fastest-growing airport and is taking on more and more flights. <b>Blackpool</b> has an international airport nearby offering a lot of package-holiday flights.</li>
</ul><ul><li><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.newcastleairport.com">Newcastle International Airport</a></b> is the only airport in the North East of England offering a daily service to and from Dubai, with connecting flights into Australia and the far east, it is also a hub for easyjet, Thomson, Thomas Cook and Jet2, with flights available to over 100 destinations.</li>
</ul><p>Smaller regional airports include:</p>
<ul><li><b>Bristol</b>, <b>East Midlands</b>, <b>Exeter</b>, <b>Robin Hood</b>, <b>Carlisle</b>, <b>Leeds Bradford</b> and <b>Durham Tees Valley</b> all have cheap flights to mainland Europe with Ryanair, Jet2, easyJet and Flybe.</li>
<li><b>Southampton</b> and <b>Bournemouth</b> Airports are medium-sized, though they have bargain-price flights with Ryanair and Flybe and can be accessed by rail from London Waterloo station.</li>
<li><b>Norwich</b> has a busy route to Amsterdam, as well as Flybe flights across the UK.</li>
<li><b>Humberside</b> has daily flights to Amsterdam, and a busy service to the North Sea oil rigs.</li>
<li><b>Newquay Cornwall Airport</b> has a fluctuating number of flights in recent years, mainly due to a £5 'development fee' introduced in 2006, but is ideal for beating the traffic jams down to this beautiful part of Britain.</li>
<li>In the South-east there is <b>London Ashford Airport</b>, also known as Lydd Airport has rather seasonal, limited services as does <b>Oxford Airport</b>. <b>Kent International Airport</b> is similarly small.</li>
</ul><p>In <b>Scotland</b>, the major airports with links to London and abroad are:</p>
<ul><li><b>Edinburgh</b> (Scotland's busiest airport, with a wide variety of European and North American routes)</li>
<li><b>Glasgow</b> has two airports: Glasgow International <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.glasgowairport.com/">[10]</a> (for most major airlines) and Glasgow Prestwick <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.gpia.co.uk/">[11]</a> (for Ryanair and some low-cost flights)</li>
<li><b>Aberdeen</b></li>
<li><b>Inverness</b></li>
<li>Both the <b>Orkney</b> and <b>Shetland</b> Isles' airports have links to Scandinavia besides domestic flights in the UK.</li>
</ul><p><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.cwlfly.com/">Cardiff International</a></b>, the only international airport in <b><a href="/wiki/Wales" title="Wales">Wales</a></b>, is a major hub of Flybe and Thomas Cook, which has a few long-haul flights, such as Barbados. <b>Anglesey Airport</b> is the only other noteworthy airport of Wales, which has one flight a day to the Isle of Man and Cardiff.</p>
<p>In <b>Northern Ireland</b>, <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.belfastairport.com/">Belfast International Airport</a></b> and <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.belfastcityairport.com/">George Best City Airport</a></b> both serve the province's capital. <b>Belfast International</b> has several North American long-haul flights, while <b>Belfast City</b> is very conveniently situated 12 minutes from the city centre by local bus. <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.cityofderryairport.com/">City of Derry Airport</a></b> serves the northwest with a limited number of international and domestic flights.</p>
<p><b>Isle of Man</b>, <b>Guernsey</b> and <b>Jersey</b> all have their own respective airports, with well-serviced flights from around the UK, as well as to France and further afield. Flying is probably more convenient than ferry to these islands.</p>
<p>Due to an increase in airport security and aviation security in general, long delays are possible when checking in for a flight. Additionally a passport or valid photo ID (such as photo driver's licence, national ID card, etc.) is required for internal flights.</p>

During the summer an additional weekly train operates to <a href="/wiki/Avignon" title="Avignon">Avignon</a> and during the winter a weekly service runs a ski service direct to the French Alps. Through tickets and connections are available through Lille, Paris and Brussels from many European cities to most large UK cities.</p>
<p>Journey times to central London average two hours fifteen minutes from <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a> and one hour fifty minutes from <a href="/wiki/Brussels" title="Brussels">Brussels</a>. A second class return from Paris to London costs between ?85 and ?230. While it can be cheaper to fly from London to Paris using a low-cost airline, bear in mind that the journeys to the airports can be expensive and time-consuming.</p>
<p>Passengers travelling by Eurostar to the UK from Paris (Gare du Nord), Lille (Europe), Calais (Fréthun) and Brussels (Zuid-Midi) stations undergo UK passport/identity card checks in France/Belgium before boarding, rather than on arrival in the UK. The UK passport checks take place after the French/Belgian passport/identity card exit checks in the stations. However, UK customs checks take place on arrival in the UK. Eurostar passengers not travelling to the UK (e.g. Brussels Zuid-Midi to Lille/Calais) are not required to go through UK passport/identity card checks as such journeys are within the <a href="/wiki/Europe#Get_around" title="Europe">Schengen Area</a>.</p>

<p>Drivers entering Northern Ireland from the Republic of Ireland will usually find they have done so without noticing. There are no border controls, and only the major roads will display signs stating that you are leaving one country and entering the other. However, the appropriate travel documents for your nationality are still required for cross-border travel despite the lack of border controls and you are liable under the laws of the country you are attempting to enter if you don't have any. It should be noted that road signs in the Republic of Ireland are in kilometres while those in Northern Ireland are in miles so it is advisable to take note of the differences in signs and road markings when driving in border areas.</p>

<p>Given the short distances involved, flying is rarely the cheapest or most convenient option for domestic travel within the UK with the possible exception of between southern England and Scotland, or where a sea crossing would otherwise be involved, such as between Britain and Northern Ireland or travel to and from many Scottish islands.

To get the best fare, it is advisable to book as far in advance as possible. It is worth noting that many regional airports are not connected to the national rail network, with connections to the nearest cities served by relatively expensive buses. <b>Photo ID</b> is required before boarding domestic flights in the UK. Check your airline's requirements carefully before setting out.</p>
<p>'Screen-scraper' comparison websites can be a useful way to compare flight costs between airports or even city pairs (suggesting alternative airports, for instance). Beware that some airlines, such as Ryanair, object to being included in these searches, so these sites are not always comprehensive.</p>

Simplified UK Rail Network</div>

<p><b>See also: <a href="/wiki/Rail_travel_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="Rail travel in the United Kingdom">Rail travel in the United Kingdom</a></b></p>
<p>The UK operates two railway networks. In England, Scotland and Wales the extensive <b>National Rail</b> network covers some 34,000 km (21,000 miles) covering most of Great Britain, from <a href="/wiki/Penzance" title="Penzance">Penzance</a> in <a href="/wiki/Cornwall" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> to <a href="/wiki/Thurso_(Scottish_Highlands)" title="Thurso (Scottish Highlands)" class="mw-redirect">Thurso</a> in the far north of <a href="/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> and including over 2,600 stations. Train travel is very popular in Britain, with many services busy and passenger numbers rising steadily every year. A mixed system is operated, with infrastructure being state-owned while commercial franchises operate trains, to a destination and service pattern specified by the government.</p>
<p>In Northern Ireland there is a state-owned system called <b>Northern Ireland Railways</b> (NIR) which is separate and uses a different track gauge (the Irish gauge). For more details on rail travel in Northern Ireland, see <a href="/wiki/Rail_travel_in_Ireland" title="Rail travel in Ireland">Rail travel in Ireland</a>; the remainder of this section will focus on rail travel in England, Scotland and Wales (i.e. the island of Great Britain).</p>
<p>While criticised by some as inefficient and there are issues such as overcrowding at peak times, the train is an effective and enjoyable way to explore Britain and get around places of interest. It is also by far the best option for inter-city travel, with most inter-city trains travelling at 200 km/h (125 mph) and stations in most cities and towns being in the city-centre. Regional services travel up to 160 km/h (100 mph). While this means that services are not as fast as the high-speed lines of France, Germany or Japan, there is a relatively high standard of service on both main and secondary routes.</p>
<p>In recent years the privatised system has been accused of many failings and there are frequent calls to re-nationalise the entire network, but today most train companies offer a good service, particularly on inter-city and mainline routes, though punctuality varies considerably. Despite the large number of companies, for the traveller the experience is remarkably well-integrated. Tickets can be bought from any one station to any other in Great Britain, no matter how far away, how many train companies or changes of train are needed to get there. However, you?ll find tickets cost less the further in advance you book ? if you buy a ticket at the station on the day of travel, fares can be shockingly high (and surprisingly low if you book a few weeks in advance).</p>

<p>The track, stations and infrastructure (with the exception of preserved railways) belongs to the state-owned <b>Network Rail</b>. Trains are operated by privately-owned and commercially run <b>Train operating companies</b> (TOCs), although currently one company (East Coast) is state-owned but operated commercially.

<p>The essential source for rail travel information in Great Britain is the <b>National Rail</b> website <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/">[66]</a>. It includes all timetables, an extremely useful journey planner (which is by far the easiest way to plan a journey), ticket prices and detailed information about every railway station in the country. You can also access this information using the <b>National Rail Enquiries</b> phone service on +44 845 748 49 50.</p>
<p>However, <b>National Rail do not sell tickets</b>. You buy tickets from a station ticket office, from an automated ticket machine at a station, or (as British people increasingly do) over the internet, from any train company?s website or www.thetrainline.com. All train companies sell tickets for all services in Great Britain regardless of which company operates them, and the central ticketing means you buy a through-ticket from one station to any other in Great Britain irrespective of which train companies you?ll need to travel on or how many changes.</p>
<p>Here are two of the best websites for buying tickets. You can choose to have the tickets mailed to you, or to collect them at any automated ticket machine at a station you specify when booking.</p>
<ul><li><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.eastcoast.co.uk/">East Coast</a></b> is a state-owned inter-city operator. They have a user-friendly website which allows you to compare the cost of two one-way tickets versus a return ticket. A lowest fare finder also quickly shows you the cheapest combination of trains for any journey in the UK. There is no charge for credit/debit card payments or ticket collection/delivery in the UK.</li>
<li><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.thetrainline.com/">thetrainline.com</a></b> is one of the largest UK train ticketing websites, and the oldest and best-known. Thetrainline.com provides the ticketing software to the websites of many of the train operating companies (but not East Coast). Be warned that it charges a card handling fee and an additional fee to collect your tickets from a station or to have them posted to you.</li>
</ul><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Classes_of_Travel">Classes of Travel</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=36" title="Edit section: Classes of Travel">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>Two classes operate: standard class and 1st class. Commuter trains and some local services offer standard class only.</p>
<ul><li><b>Standard class</b> has two seats either side of the aisle with a mix of 'facing table' or more private 'airline-style' seats.</li>
<li><b>First class</b> has two seats and one seat either side of the aisle, with a larger, more comfortable seat, more legroom, and on inter-city routes, an at-seat service of drinks, refreshments and a newspaper (not all at-seat services are available at the weekend).</li>
</ul><p>In both 1st and standard class, most trains also provide:</p>
<ul><li>Free seat reservations (not commuter or local services), indicated by a paper tag or electronic display above each seat</li>
<li>A walk-up <b>buffet</b>, or a <b>trolley service</b> of drinks and refreshments moving through the train</li>
<li>Air conditioning (not commuter or local services)</li>
<li>At least one carriage with a fully disabled-accessible toilet and baby changing facilities</li>
<li>On inter-city services, a <b>wireless internet</b> service (a charge may apply)</li>
<li>Most inter-city trains provide a <b>"Quiet Coach"</b> where use of mobile phones, iPods, conversations, and any other noise is not permitted.</li>
</ul><p>There are also six scheduled overnight sleeper trains that operate every night of the week except Saturday:</p>
<ul><li><b>The Lowland Sleeper</b>, which leaves from <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a> Euston as one train, but divides to <a href="/wiki/Glasgow" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a></li>
<li><b>The Highland Sleeper</b>, which leaves from <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a> Euston as one train, but divides to <a href="/wiki/Aberdeen" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fort_William" title="Fort William">Fort William</a> and <a href="/wiki/Inverness" title="Inverness">Inverness</a>.</li>
<li><b>The Night Riviera</b>, which travels from <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a> Paddington to <a href="/wiki/Plymouth_(England)" title="Plymouth (England)">Plymouth</a> and <a href="/wiki/Penzance" title="Penzance">Penzance</a></li>
</ul><p>Reservations are compulsory on sleeper trains, and a supplement may be payable on top of day-train ticket prices to reserve a berth. Advance-purchase tickets called <b>Bargain Berths</b> are available on London-Scotland sleepers from £19 to £49. They are only available from the ScotRail website <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.scotrail.co.uk/">[67]</a>. All sleeper trains offer:</p>
<ul><li>Reclining seated accommodation (comparable to daytime first class but no at-seat service)</li>
<li>Standard Class (a cabin with two berths; solo travellers will often need to share with a stranger of the same sex)</li>
<li>First Class (a identical cabin but with a single berth and more generous breakfast, toiletry pack and access to departure and arrival lounges at larger stations)</li>
</ul><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Tickets">Tickets</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=37" title="Edit section: Tickets">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>Generally, the ticket prices for a particular type of ticket are the same regardless of operator you choose to travel on. However the cheaper or promo tickets will be restricted to one operator only.</p>
<p>On all except local and commuter routes and the new High Speed 1 from London St. Pancras to <a href="/wiki/Kent" title="Kent">Kent</a>, you save money by <b>booking in advance</b> (tickets normally go on sale three months in advance) and by <b>travelling at off-peak times</b>; peak train travel is much more expensive and stressful as many trains are seriously overcrowded with commuters. Off-peak is any time after 9.30am on a weekday, and all weekends and public holidays. Some train companies around London also have a peak in the afternoon rush hour. You must have a ticket before boarding a train, and many stations now have subway-style ticket barriers. An exception occurs if your station has no ticket office OR machine (i.e. it is a very minor or rural station) in which case you must buy a ticket from the conductor on the train at the first opportunity. If you do not, depending on the operator and their policy, you may be liable to pay a 'penalty fare'.</p>
<p>There are three types of ticket, which allow you to choose between flexibility and value. In increasing order of cost per mile, tickets are classed as:</p>
<ul><li><b>Advance</b> - Buy in advance, travel only on a specific train at a specific day and time</li>
<li><b>Off-Peak</b> - Buy any time, travel 'off-peak' (usually after 9.30am and all day at weekends)</li>
<li><b>Anytime</b> - Buy any time, travel any time</li>
</ul><p>Advance tickets are only sold as single (one-way) tickets; to make a return journey, simply purchase two singles. With the exception of some suburban and commuter trains, the cheapest fares are almost always Advance tickets. These are released for sale in limited numbers approximately 12 weeks in advance, and can only be used on the train specified on the reservation. If you travel on any other train or the wrong train, you will be charged an expensive full-price ticket or a penalty fare or else thrown off at the next station. When purchasing an off-peak or anytime ticket, return fares are normally only a little more expensive than a single (one-way ticket).</p>
<p>A <b>ticket does not guarantee a seat</b> unless you also have a <b>seat reservation</b>. Depending on ticket type and train company, this may come automatically with the ticket or you may be asked if you wish to reserve a seat - ask if you are unsure. Some trains (mostly local and commuter services) do not have reserved seats. If you have no seat reservation, you may have to stand if the train is busy. Seat reservations are normally free. Within London, the Oyster smartcard system (refer to the main <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a> article for details), is valid within the Greater London boundary on National Rail services - this is cheaper than buying paper Anytime tickets at the station, but only if you don't intend to travel beyond Zone 6. If you stay on the train beyond Zone 6, you are liable for a wallet-shocking penalty fare.</p>

<p><b>Ranger</b> and <b>Rover</b> tickets are tickets that permit unlimited travel with relatively few restrictions over a defined geographical area for a period of anything from one to fourteen days. A full list of tickets is available with their terms and conditions from National Rail <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://nationalrail.co.uk/times_fares/promotions/rangers_and_rovers.html">[68]</a>. These tickets include Rovers for almost every region of the UK, but notable tickets include:</p>
<ul><li><b>All Line Rover: 7 or 14 Days</b> - These allow 7 or 14 days travel on almost all scheduled rail services throughout England, Scotland and Wales. As of May 2012, they cost £450 (7 days)or £680 (14 days) for standard class, and £680 (7 days) or £1040 (14 days) for 1st class, with discounts for children and railcard holders.</li>
<li><b>Freedom of Scotland Travelpass: 4 days in 8</b> or <b>8 days in 15</b> cost £129 and £173 respectively, with discounts for children and railcard holders.</li>

<p>Unlike much of Europe, the UK drives on the left-hand side. Most cars in the UK are manual ("stick-shift") transmission, and car rental companies will allocate you a manual transmission car unless you specifically ask for an automatic when you make a reservation.</p>
<p>A car will get you pretty much anywhere in the UK. Parking is a problem in large cities, and especially in London, can be very expensive. Fuel is heavily taxed and therefore expensive, currently at around <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.theaa.com/motoring_advice/fuel/">£1.34 per litre</a> <i>(around US$2.05 per litre, or US$7.76 per gallon)</i>. The cheapest fuel is usually available at supermarkets and branches of Tesco, Sainsburys, Morrisons and Asda tend to have fuel stations in their car parks which are often cheaper than the big name fuel stations like Esso/Exxon, Shell and BP.</p>
<p>Like in the US but unlike the rest of the world, the UK continues to use the imperial system for road signs while speed limits are indicated in mph. However, many height and width signs are now in metric as well and all weight signs are in tonnes; all motorways now have locator indicators in kilometres situated at intervals of 500 m.</p>
<p>There are no tolls on any roads with the exception of a few large bridges/tunnels and one <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.m6toll.co.uk/">privately financed motorway in the Midlands</a>. There is a congestion charge of £8 per day to drive in central London.</p>
<p>Traffic can be very heavy, especially during 'rush hour', when commuters are on their way to and from work - typically 7AM-10AM and 4PM-7PM. School holidays can make a noticeable reduction in traffic, however, particularly in the morning rush hour.</p>
<p>The M25 London orbital motorway is notorious for having bad traffic (known to most Londoners as London's car park because sometimes all the traffic comes to a standstill) - it is best avoided on Monday mornings and Friday afternoons, use it only if you need to, and take local advice if you plan to drive to Heathrow to catch a plane. The M6 through Birmingham is another traffic blackspot as well as the M8 in Glasgow (the second most congested motorway after the M25). You can typically bet on finding a traffic jam if you drive for more than 90 minutes on the motorway system, especially as you approach cities. Checking local traffic reports on the radio or websites such as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.highways.gov.uk/">Highways Agency</a> or <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.frixo.com/">Frixo</a> can help if you know you need to travel during busy hours.</p>
<p>Many cities operate a "Park and Ride" scheme, with car parks on the edge of the city and cheap buses into the city centre, and you should consider using them. In major cities (particularly London, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and Birmingham) it is usually a much better option to park on the outskirts and take public transport to the centre. This not only saves money on parking and fuel but also saves a lot of time as heavy traffic, twisty one way systems, and limited parking space causes long delays.</p>
<p>Parking on-street is usually heavily restricted. Never park on a white, double yellow or double red line (stopping on white or red lines is illegal. Parking on a single-yellow line is restricted (typically no-parking during the daytime e.g. 7AM-7PM) and the restrictions are displayed on roadside yellow signs. Many residential streets require a resident's parking permit to park on the street, although outer-suburbs have less restrictions. On-street parking in cities may be restricted to disability-badge holders or be heavily metered, and is often for no more than a 1?2 hours stay in the daytime but is often free at night. Surface lots generally operate the pay 'n' display payment system - you must buy a ticket from a vending machine, select how many hours you wish to pay and then place the ticket on your dashboard in clear view - these places are regularly patrolled and if you don't return to your car before the allotted time you'll get a penalty or get clamped. Often you'll need to enter the numeric digits from your car's number plate when buying the ticket to prevent people from 'selling on' tickets with leftover time. Multi-storeys are usually multi-level buildings or in larger cities may be located underground. Most have barrier-controls - you'll be issued with a ticket upon entry. When returning to your vehicle you must either pay at a 'pay station' (a self-service terminal inside the car park's lobby) in which you insert the ticket and pay the required amount - the ticket will be given back to you and you must insert it into the slot at the exit barrier; or alternatively you will pay a cashier at the exit barrier - it'll normally explain the payment process on the ticket. Parking charges vary from less than 50p per hour in small towns to over £4 an hour in the largest cities. Many larger cities have digital displays on the approach roads indicating how many parking spaces are available in each car park.</p>
<p>In any town, expect regular bus services between the centre, suburbs and nearby villages, and less frequent services to more rural areas. London also has the largest mass-transit system in the world - the <a href="/wiki/London_Underground" title="London Underground" class="mw-redirect">London Underground</a> and an extensive overground system and bus network too. London, Manchester, Birmingham, Sheffield, Nottingham and Blackpool have trams covering parts of those cities. Outside of London, Liverpool has the most extensive metro system (Merseyrail), spanning from several stations in the city centre to those in the outer suburbs. Newcastle has a similar network. Greater Manchester also has an extensive local train network in addition to its expanding 'Metrolink' tram system. Glasgow has a small underground rail system in the centre and a local train network. In some cities buses can be slow moving due to traffic congestion.</p>
<p>The UK has a comprehensive system of road numbers. These generally take precedence on signs: British roads are signed on a route-based rather than destination oriented basis. Therefore, before setting out on a long journey, plan the route you are going to take and note the road numbers you will need to follow. It is very unusual to see destinations, signed more than about 50 miles/80 km in advance. Other than that, UK road signs are excellent and should be very easy to follow. Road numbers are indicated by a letter and a number as in the rest of Europe and sign colours and letters are generally the same as on the rest of European routes, whilst allocated, are unsigned.</p>
<p><b>Motorways (prefix 'M'- blue signs, white route numbers)</b> are fast, long distance routes that connect the major cities. The speed limit is 70 mph/115 km/h for cars (lower for other types of vehicle) and certain vehicles, such as pedestrians, cyclists and those operated by learner drivers are prohibited. Junctions are numbered. The motorways are the best means of travelling long distances by car, but expect delays at peak times or in poor weather.</p>
<p><b>Primary routes (prefix 'A' - green signs, yellow route numbers)</b> connect large towns with each other and with the motorway network. Primary routes usually offer fast journey times, but because they tend to go through towns rather than around them, expect delays at peak times.</p>
<p><b>Secondary routes (prefix 'A' - white signs, black route numbers)</b> connect smaller towns, interchangeable with B roads.</p>
<p><b>B-roads (prefix 'B' - white signs, black route numbers)</b> are the larger of the back roads.</p>
<p><b>Minor routes (white signs)</b> like country lanes or residential streets.</p>
<p>A route number followed by <b>(M)</b> means upgraded to motorway standard - for example <b>A3(M)</b> means part of the route A3 that has been upgraded to motorway.</p>
<p>A route number in brackets means 'leading to' - for example <b>A507 (M1)</b> means you can reach the M1 by following route A507.</p>
<p>Speed limits for cars and motorcycles are 70 mph <i>(115 km/h)</i> on motorways and dual carriageways (i.e. roads divided by a grassy area or other hard barrier between opposing directions of traffic); 60 mph <i>(100 km/h)</i> on single carriageway (i.e. undivided) roads unless otherwise signposted; and 30 mph <i>(50 km/h)</i> in built-up unless signs show otherwise. The use of 20 mph <i>(30 km/h)</i> zones has become increasingly common to improve safety in areas such as those around schools. Although national limits still technically apply to minor roads and back lanes, driving for the conditions is strongly recommended.</p>
<p>Speed cameras are widespread on all types of road, though more used in some areas than others (England's largest county, <a href="/wiki/North_Yorkshire" title="North Yorkshire">North Yorkshire</a>, for example, has a policy of using no fixed enforcement cameras on its highways). Static cameras are often well signed, painted bright colours with clear markings on the road. While this might seem rather strange, the idea is to improve their public acceptance as a 'safety' measure (rather than the widely held opinion that they're there to collect money).</p>
<p>There are some variable mandatory speed limits on the M25 to the west of London (enforced by cameras, again), and the M42 near Birmingham - these are shown on overhead gantries inside a red circle; other temporary speed limits shown on matrix boards are recommended but not mandatory. Apart from these and around roadworks, the motorways are generally free of fixed speed cameras. Speeds on motorways are generally much higher than the stated speed limit (usually at least 80 mph/130 km/h). Driving at slower speeds in the outside (overtaking lane) may cause frustration to other drivers.</p>
<p>Driving standards are relatively well-maintained in the UK, with the road system being (statistically) among the safest in Europe. It has long been known by visitors that a foreign licence plate makes you largely immune from speed cameras, congestion charge cameras and Traffic (Parking) Wardens. If you choose to take your chances, be aware you may just hit upon the one Camera Operator/Warden who can be bothered to take the trouble to track down your address from your home licensing authority. British authorities have access to vehicle registration databases from various other countries. Also, British hire car companies will charge traffic fines to your credit card, long after you have left the country. Traffic police patrol the motorways in marked and unmarked cars. Any police officers, regardless of their normal duties, will pursue a vehicle seen driving dangerously.</p>
<p>Don't drink and drive in the UK. Although the maximum limit is 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood (0.08%), police in the UK have been known to 'pull' drivers who are technically below this, especially if their driving is erattic or dangerous. Going 'over the limit' is a criminal offence, you will be arrested and spend a night in the cells. The police often patrol roads in cities and town centres on Friday and Saturday night, on the lookout for drink drivers. Enforcement of drink driving laws are extremely strict and police will always take action on those failing a breath test or those refusing to do so. Fines are up to £5000, minimum driving ban is 12 months for a first offence. As well as a 6 months prison sentence for being over the limit, additional penalties may be imposed if the driving was dangerous.</p>
<p>Drivers from abroad should take note that many British drivers regard the flashing of headlights as a signal that <b>they can proceed</b>, rather than as a warning, or as a signal to slow down due to the presence of police. This misunderstanding has led to a number of accidents.</p>
<p>In a dangerous situation, where there is a risk of death or injury, sound your horn, even during the night. The inappropriate use of the horn is illegal between 23:00 and 07:30, or when stationary on the road.</p>
<p>It is also an offence to use your mobile phone or any other handheld device whilst driving, although provision is made for the use of hands-free telephone equipment which are exempt from the law. Police will stop you for using your mobile phone and a £60 penalty will be issued on the spot. This fine will be accompanied with 3 points endorsed on your licence.</p>
<p>All vehicle occupants are required by law to wear a seat belt. Persons not wearing a seat belt may receive a £30 fine, although this does not come with any points. If a child under the age of 14 is not correctly restrained, the parent or guardian, normally the driver, is responsible and a fine will be issued for that offence also. Children under 1.4 metres and under 12 years of age are also legally required to use a child booster seat for safety reasons. It is illegal to put a rear-facing baby seat on the front seat with an active airbag. If possible, babies should always have their seats installed in the rear of the car. If their is so much cargo that a baby seat has to be put on the front seat, the passenger front airbag should be turned off. Turn it on again if you carry an adult passenger in the front seat afterwards.</p>
<p>Use of fog lights where there is no fog is also an offence for which you may receive a £30 fine.</p>
<p>The road rules differ from other countries: side roads never have priority, there is no requirement to stop for school buses, overtaking on the left is illegal, and you may not turn left over a red light. There are no 4 way stop junctions in the UK; priority should be clearly marked on the road.</p>
<p>There are lots of roundabouts (circular) across the UK, from large multi-lane roundabouts at dual carriageway junctions to small mini-roundabouts on local streets. The rules for entering them are the same - you have priority over traffic that has not yet entered it, and you must give way to anybody already on the roundabout (who would collide with your right side if you entered it). Be careful of two lane roundabouts, there are complicated rules for which lane you should be in which UK drivers learn and expect other drivers to follow. You should be fine provided you're cautious and keep an eye on other traffic. Some roundabouts are arranged in such designs and quick sequence that can make you dizzy. Take it easy until you get used to it.</p>

<p>Local bus services (a categorisation which also includes many medium-haul inter-urban services) cover the entire country, but are of variable quality and cost. Rural bus services are in general better than in France and the USA, but not so good as in Italy or Germany. Services range from deep-rural village services operating once a week or less, to intensive urban routes operating every few minutes. All communities except the very smallest villages have some kind of bus service. All buses in the UK are required to display the route number and destination clearly on the front. Almost all are "one person operation", i.e. there is no conductor and you must pay the driver as you board. The vast majority of bus stops are "request stops", meaning that you must put your arm out as the bus approaches to signal that you want it to stop. Likewise once on the bus, you must ring the bell in advance of the stop you want to get off at.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="London">London</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=46" title="Edit section: London">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>In London, the iconic red buses cover the entire city, with most routes running at high frequencies from early morning until late night, and some operating 24 hours. Service frequencies are such that timetables are generally unnecessary for daytime travel. Comprehensive route maps are available from a variety of outlets and the Transport for London website, and stop-specific maps and timetables are displayed clearly at most bus stops. Buses are modern and highly specified, and are "low floor" offering easy access for wheelchairs, buggies and the elderly. Walk-up cash fares can be relatively expensive, but all-day and longer period tickets (including combined bus, rail and tube options) are available, offering excellent value. For travelling in London, the Transport for London website <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/">[71]</a> is an incredibly useful website with a journey planner with maps, all fares, information on planned engineering works (there are plenty of those on the weekend) as well as live updates. It is an indispensable tool if considering even minor trips on public transport, which is an experience in itself.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Elsewhere">Elsewhere</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=47" title="Edit section: Elsewhere">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>Bus services in the UK outside of London are privatised and deregulated, with any licensed operator free to run any route and timetable that they wish. Therefore, co-ordination of services with each other and with rail services can be poor, and tickets often not inter-available. Return tickets are usually much cheaper than two singles, and most operators offer discounted fares for children. Most operators offer day or longer period tickets valid across their own network which can represent very good value, giving all-day travel for as little as £4, but are little use if you need to use more than one operator. However, combined day tickets valid across more than one operator's network are also available in some areas. Weekday daytime services are frequent and comprehensive in many areas, particularly larger towns and cities. However, almost universally, service levels reduce sharply in the evenings and on Sundays. In the larger cities, for example Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh, there is an extensive night bus network available.</p>
<p>In areas with a multitude of operators, obtaining comprehensive map/timetable information for the area can be difficult. It is not uncommon for operators to attempt to pass off their services as being 'the' network for the town or area in their publicity material - making no mention of the fact that other routes (or in some cases alternative departure times on the same routes) are available, operated by competitors. Many local authorities do attempt to produce comprehensive timetables and/or maps for all services in their area regardless of who operates them - these are well worth obtaining and are commonly available from Tourist Information Centres. However it is still worth checking with the operator(s) before travelling to ensure that the information is up to date, as timetables can change frequently.</p>

<p>Coach travel tends to be slower than train travel, as well as less frequent, although it is comfortable and often much cheaper. Coaches, like trains will also generally take you right to the centre of town.</p>
<p>The largest coach companies in the UK are:</p>
<ul><li>National Express <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.nationalexpress.com/coach">[72]</a> is the largest long distance bus service in the UK, and services all major destinations on the mainland; they sell tickets online and at coach terminals. Prices start at just £1 one way for promotional 'funfares' between major city-pairs, although remain quite expensive on less competitive routes such as those serving airports.</li>
<li>Megabus <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://uk.megabus.com">[73]</a> is a service between a limited number of major destinations at cut-throat prices, as low as £1 +50p booking charge for some routes if booked well in advance. Understandably, it is very popular with students. To get the cheapest fares you should book a week or two ahead. However fares are often still good value when booked with less time (sometimes £8 London-Manchester booked only two days in advance). Tickets must be bought online or using the booking line (0900 160 0900, premium rate, at 60 pence per minute) and <b>cannot</b> be bought from the driver.</li>
<li>CityLink <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.citylink.co.uk/">[74]</a> services destinations in Scotland. They sell their tickets online, by text, or from the driver, although it is always advised to book your tickets in advance. Some routes also carry Megabus passengers.</li>
<li>Dot2Dot <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.dot2.com/">[75]</a> is a specialised service offered by National Express coaches, providing door-to-door airport transfer service, operating between central London and Heathrow and Gatwick airports. Prices start at £17.50.</li>
<li>easyBus <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.easybus.co.uk/">[76]</a> is London's low cost airport transfer service from easyGroup. One-way fares start at £2, servicing Stansted, Luton, and Gatwick airports. Advance booking recommended.</li>
</ul><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_taxi">By taxi</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=49" title="Edit section: By taxi">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>There are two types of taxis in the United Kingdom:- Metered (black) cabs that can be hailed in the street and are mostly found in larger towns and cities; and minicabs (private hire taxis) which must be ordered by telephone.</p>
<p><b>Black Cabs</b> These are useful for travelling within cities - the name originates from the old 1960s purpose-built Austin FX3 taxis which were originally painted black, but today are usually covered in advertisements. In major cities, custom-built vehicles which seat 5 people are commonly used as metered taxis, but in smaller cities regular cars or people-carriers are used instead. These taxis can be hailed on the street or picked up from a taxi rank (usually found near major shopping areas and transport hubs). The rate varies, typically starting at around £2-3 and rising at around £1 a mile, making them fairly expensive. Add night charges, waiting charges, luggage charges for large suitcases etc. on to the meter as well, and travelling by taxi can be expensive unless you are in a large group. A short 10 minute trip would normally cost between £3-5. The 'Taxi' sign on the roof is illuminated when a taxi is available.</p>
<p><b>Minicabs</b> More common in suburbs and smaller towns, minicabs can only be used by telephone ordering and charge fixed prices to different destinations. Local telephone directories usually advertise taxi companies, and the phone numbers are usually painted in big numbers on the side of their vehicles. Minicabs are usually much cheaper, fares for long journeys can often be negotiated (although you should agree the fare with the phone operator when booking, not with the driver) and most companies have a variety of vehicle sizes from small saloons (Ford Mondeo, Skoda Octavia, Peugeot 406 etc.) up to large 12-seater minivans so if you have a large group you can specify the vehicle size. Some minicab firms specialise in serving airports and offer discounted rates.</p>
<p><b>Fake taxis</b> Fake taxis are not a major problem and are mostly found around the major airports. A few tips: Check that the taxi has a rear taxi-licence plate on the rear bumper and that it carries the name of the local authoritative council. The driver's taxi licence should be displayed on the dashboard. The meter displays the correct rate (the metered fares are usually advertised on the side of the taxi). If calling a minicab, the taxi company will ask your last-name and your phone number - the driver should know this when he picks you up. If approached by a taxi driver claiming that you booked their taxi (particularly in airports or nightlife districts), ask them to confirm your name and phone number - if they don't know then it is most likely that they are fake. Most local councils require licensed taxis to be newer than 10 or 15 years old. Many fake taxis use older vehicles.</p>

<p>Ferries link the mainland to the many offshore islands including the Isles of Scilly from Penzance; the Isle of Wight from Southampton and Portsmouth; the Isle of Man from Liverpool and Ireland and the Orkneys and Shetland Islands from Aberdeen and the far north of Scotland. There are also numerous car and passenger ferry routes between England and France and between Ireland and the UK. There are also regular ferry services between Northern Ireland and Scotland and these depart Larne, Belfast, Troon, Stranraer and Cairnryan. There are also routes from Northern Ireland to Birkenhead and Fleetwood (both near Liverpool in England).</p>

<p>Pedestrians are banned on motorways, motorway junctions, as well as on certain primary routes. However, aside from those exceptions, <a href="/wiki/Hitchhiking" title="Hitchhiking">hitchhiking</a> is not illegal. The British are very aware of safety, and you may expect a long wait for a ride.</p>
<p>If you use signs, it's fairly customary to use the number of the road on them rather than the destination. In other words, from Birmingham to London you wouldn't use a sign "LONDON" but rather "M25". Two places where signs are quite useful are <a href="/wiki/Land%27s_End" title="Land's End">Land's End</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_O%27Groats" title="John O'Groats" class="mw-redirect">John O'Groats</a>, the two extremes of the country, especially if your sign says the other.</p>
<p>Note that traffic in more remote areas of Scotland, Wales, and Cornwall can be quite scarce.</p>

<p>The UK can be both a cyclist's dream and nightmare. Fortunately cycling is popular as both a sport and a means of transportation. Bike rental exists in some cities e.g. Cambridge or Oxford and in some scenic areas.</p>
<p>The Barclays Cycle Hire scheme provides a network of approximately 8,000 bicycles and 570 docking stations across central London, covering an area from White City in the west to Docklands in the east. The scheme is available to walk-up users and charges a daily fee (currently £1, paid by credit or debit card) and, for journeys exceeding 30 minutes, a per-use fee is also charged. Between journeys, users are expected to return their bicycle to a docking station, taking another bicycle for subsequent journeys; the bicycles do not have locks, and journeys of under 30 minutes do not incur a per-use fee. It can be difficult to find bicycles (or spaces at docking stations, in the evenings) at the major rail termini during peak hours, as the scheme is popular with commuters. As well as on each docking station, cycle/dock availability and maps are available online. Should your intended docking station be full, you can request up to 15 minutes additional time free of charge.</p>
<p>The wheels of choice for most British cyclists is the hybrid bike - they have the comfort and practicality of a city bike combined with the performance (multi-speed gearing) and ruggedness of a mountain bike. Conventional mountain bikes and single-speed roadsters are also common, and folding bikes are becoming more popular in major cities. Bicycles are expensive in the UK - expect to pay £100 or more for a basic model. They are sold by individual manufacturer's dealers (e.g. Dawes, Raleigh, Giant), automobile product stores (e.g. Halfords), sport accessory stores (e.g. Decathlon) and through private bicycle retailers. Cheaper used bikes can be purchased online via websites such as eBay or may be advertised in newspapers, notice-boards etc.</p>
<p>Urban cycling varies city-to-city. Most cities have designated cycle-lanes although they are routinely ignored by drivers and are often shared with buses, motorcycles and taxis. Some major roads will have split-pavements for pedestrians and cyclists, whilst other times cyclists are expected to ride in the traffic. This can be dangerous if you're not a skilled cyclist and general traffic rules should be adhered to. It is advisable to wear a helmet, despite helmets not being required by law for cyclists of any age. It's a legal requirement to have a rear reflector, pedal reflectors and a bell, and front &amp; rear lights must be used at night. Also many cyclists use standard arm-signals to alert motorists - if you are turning left or right you should raise your left or right arm respectively, and if you wish to stop then you should wave your left arm up and down. Cycling is banned on certain roads - all motorways and many primary (A) roads - a sign will indicate this. It is illegal to cycle on the pavement. This is punishable by a fine of up to £500.</p>
<p>Most cities will have designated bike-parking areas with bicycle racks and are almost always free. Carry a good lock with you as bike-theft is common. Bicycles are permitted on SOME trains, depending on the operator. Commuter trains generally allow folding bicycles only, some regional trains may have a rack that can carry 2-3 bicycles, while many intercity trains have a baggage car that can hold many bikes. Check with the operator before-hand - bikes will almost always require a reservation: on some trains for free, some for a small charge (typically half the adult fare) whilst others will require a full-fare ticket. Reservations can be made over the phone (via National Rail or via the train operator), or at the station ticket office. Long-distance coaches also allow bicycles, although again they must be reserved and there may be a surcharge. Local city buses and regional buses don't allow full-size bikes but some operators may permit folding bicycles - you should check before hand. If a bus is quiet then it's often down to the driver's discretion. Rapid transit systems also have varying bicycle policies e.g. London Underground allows folding bicycles at all times and conventional bicycles outside of peak hours as long as the train isn't crowded.</p>
<p>The SUSTRANS Cycle Network is a series of paved and unpaved cycle tracks covering the whole country, passing through some spectacular scenery on the way. Their website (www.sustrans.co.uk) has a comprehensive cycle-map and most cycle-stores, tourist information centres and youth hostels also sell their maps.</p>

<p>Motorcycling is not a bad form of transport. It is good for navigating areas with bad traffic e.g. in Central London, where motorcyclists do not have to pay the congestion charge that cars have to pay. However, it is important to prioritise your safety - although motorcyclists make up a minority of road users, they make up the vast majority of deaths and serious injuries on Britain's roads.</p>
<p>The rider and pillion passenger on a motorbike are required by law to wear a motorbike helmet that is CE marked. It must be fastened securely. The only exemption to this law is for Sikh men, whose religion requires them to wear a turban - they would have to remove the turban to put on the helmet. If you wear eye protection (visor on helmet or motorbike goggles), which is recommended, the visor or goggles must be kitemarked. You should consider buying a helmet with ear defenders. It is advisable to wear motorbike boots and gloves, and also a leather jacket and leather trousers or jeans, as they can also prevent serious injuries in a crash.</p>
<p>It is illegal to carry more than one pillion passenger. If you wish to carry multiple passengers, use a sidecar. The pillion passenger is required by law to sit astride the motorbike on a proper seat.</p>
<p>You must not carry a pillion passenger or take your motorbike onto a motorway until you get a full licence. To get a motorbike licence, you must take and pass a test and be at least 17 years old.</p>
<p>It is important to make sure you can be seen both at night and at day, and from the sides as well as the front and rear. Wear a high-visibility jacket or fluorescent strips (during the day) and reflective strips (at night). A good idea is to wear a white or brightly coloured helmet. You can also dip your headlights, even in good daylight, to make you easier to see, but only light them fully at night.</p>

</tr></table><p><b>English</b> is spoken throughout the United Kingdom, although there are parts of major cities where immigration has led to a variety of languages being spoken as well. English spoken in the UK has several dialects, some of which may contain words which are unfamiliar to other English speakers. It is exceedingly common for a resident of the south and one of the north not to understand each other at first go, do not be afraid to ask someone to repeat themselves. Your best bet would be to ask someone under the age of 30 as generally elderly people may have thick unintelligible accents, particularly people from The North . A trained ear can also distinguish the English spoken by someone from Northern Ireland as opposed to someone from the Republic of Ireland, or even pinpoint their origin to a particular town within a county, such as Leeds or Whitby. English in Scotland and Northern Ireland can be spoken quite fast. The different dialects can be extremely different in both pronunciation and vocabulary.</p>
<p><b>Welsh</b> (<i>Cymraeg</i>) is also widely spoken in Wales, particularly in North and West Wales. The number of Welsh speakers has risen over the last few years partly due to the language's promotion in schools, but this bilingual population is still only around 30% of the total population of Wales. Government bodies whose area of responsibility covers Wales use bilingual documentation (English and Welsh) - for example, see the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.dvla.gov.uk/">website of the Swansea-based DVLA</a>. Road signs in Wales are bilingual. Even the non-Welsh-speaking majority in Wales know how to pronounce Welsh place names. Once you hear how to pronounce a name, have a go and try not to offend!</p>
<p><b>Scottish Gaelic</b> (<i>Gàidhlig</i>) can be heard in the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Highlands" title="Scottish Highlands">Scottish Highlands</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hebrides" title="Hebrides">Islands</a>, but there are only 60,000 native speakers.</p>
<p>The ancient <b>Cornish</b> language (<i>Kernowek</i>) of Cornwall, in the far south west, was revived during the twentieth century, but it is not passed down from parent to child as Welsh and Gaelic still are. Be aware, however, that Cornish place names remain and can be rather challenging to pronounce for non-locals!</p>
<p><b>Irish</b> (<i>Gaeilge</i>) is spoken in some areas of Northern Ireland, particularly in the border regions.</p>
<p><b>Scots</b> has much in common with English, and can be heard in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland (where it is known as <b>Ulster-Scots</b>) in various degrees. It can be difficult to understand, so feel free to ask someone to repeat themselves or speak more slowly. Speakers are likely to use standard English with outsiders.</p>
<p>All speakers of these minority languages are fluent to near-fluent in standard English but react well if you show an interest in their native tongue and culture. Inter-migration in the United Kingdom means you are likely to encounter people from all over the UK and beyond no matter where you visit. It is rare to find a place where all adults have the same accent or dialect.</p>
<p>There's an old joke that the people of the US and the UK are "divided by a common language", and travellers from English-speaking countries outside the UK may have difficulty catching specific words where regional accents are strong, but still there should not be any major difficulties in communicating. The British are good at understanding English spoken in a foreign accent, and visitors who speak English as a second language need not fear making mistakes. You may just get a slightly blank look for a few seconds after the end of a sentence while they 'decode' it internally. Most British people will not criticise or correct your language, although some are very keen to promote British usages over American ones when talking to non-native-speakers.</p>
<p>A few examples of words that overseas visitors may not be familiar with:</p>
<ul><li>Wee - small (Scotland, Northern Ireland, some English people), can also mean to relieve yourself (England)</li>
<li>Loch - lake (Scotland)</li>
<li>Lough - lake (Northern Ireland)</li>
<li>Aye - yes (some parts of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and North England)</li>
<li>Poke - ice cream served in a wafer cone (Northern Ireland); a paper bag, especially one containing chips or sweets (Scotland)</li>
<li>Downing Street - used to refer to the Government (similar to White House referring to the President of the United States)</li>
<li>Cymru (pronounced 'Cum-ree') - Wales (Wales)</li>
<li>Cockney rhyming slang is not a language but a collection of terms, some local and temporary, others so long-lasting that they are used by many people who don't realise that they are rhyming slang. Example of the latter: "raspberry" for the derisive noise called "Bronx cheer" in the US - derived from "raspberry tart", rhyming with "fart".</li>
</ul><p>British people have historically been very tolerant of swearing, when used in context. It is considered far less shocking to say taboo words like "cunt" or "twat" compared to in America, and can even be a term of endearment depending on the situation. Tourists should get used to hearing the word "mate" (and "boss or "bruv" to a lesser extent in London) a lot which is used in informal interaction (frequently male only) between strangers and friends alike, and is something similar to calling someone "buddy" or "pal". The use of affectionate terms between the sexes such as "darling", "love" or "sweetheart" (even, in parts of Cornwall, "lover") is common between strangers and is not meant in a sexist or patronising manner. Furthermore, British people are prone to apologising for even the smallest things, much to the amusement of some and can be considered perhaps rude to not do so. An example such as bumping into you will warrant a "sorry" and is really more like "pardon" or "excuse me".</p>
<p><b>British Sign Language</b>, or <b>BSL</b>, is the UK's primary sign language. When interpreters are present for public events, they will use BSL. In Northern Ireland, both BSL and <b>Irish Sign Language</b> (<b>ISL</b>) see use, and a <b>Northern Ireland Sign Language</b>, or <b>NISL</b>, is emerging from contact between the two. Users of Auslan or New Zealand Sign Language may understand BSL, as those languages were derived from BSL and share much vocabulary, as well as the same two-handed manual alphabet. On the other hand, users of French Sign language and related languages?notably ISL and American Sign Language?will not be able to understand BSL, as they differ markedly in syntax and vocabulary, and also use a one-handed manual alphabet.</p>

<p>From Lands' end in the south to John O?Groats and Duncansby Head in the North, there is so much to see in the United Kingdom, which is home to 25 Unecso world heritage sites. There are hundreds of free museums to enjoy across the country, many thousands of municipal parks to stroll through, tens of thousands of interesting communities to visit and many millions of acres of countryside to ramble across . It is much more than just rain and seeing whether the Queen is at home at Buckingham Palace.</p>

<p>London ? Samuel Johnson once wrote a man who is tired of London is tired of life. This is still true as London is home a wide range of attractions, Art at such galleries, such as the National Gallery, The National portrait gallery, The Tate and the Tate modern among others. There are cultural treats in the theatres and cinema of the West end and the South bank, and the recreated home of Shakespeare in the capital, the Globe. There are all the traditional tourist sites to see such as Buckingham Palace, The Houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey, St Paul?s Cathedral, <a href="/wiki/Trafalgar_Square" title="Trafalgar Square" class="mw-redirect">Trafalgar Square</a> and the London Eye.</p>
<p>Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland was initially centred on the Old Town, the castle and Holyrood Palace, but the New Town is a Georgian masterpiece. Both the Old Town and the New Town are Unesco World Heritage sites.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the United Kingdom have had a tendency to try to leave their mark on the landscape of the UK. For the length of recorded history they have been leaving little marks for the tourists of the future to enjoy. This started with our prehistoric cousins who left their mark in stone circles and mounds at such places such as Stonehenge and Avebury. Obviously these sites started as places of religious observance but today give us a glimpse of the past.</p>
<p>Then came the Romans, who as well as leaving roads, married the natives and left great marks such as villas at Fishbourne, Baths at <a href="/wiki/Bath" title="Bath">Bath</a>, <span class="new" title="Hadrian's wall (page does not exist)">Hadrian's wall</span> in the north of England, and roman walls and building all over the country, including in London, Lincoln, York and Cirencester (The capitals of the four British provinces in the late Roman period)</p>
<p>After the Romans left, the United Kingdom fell along with the rest of Western Europe into the Dark Ages. Even during this period when much of the learning, cilivation and culture of the Roman period was lost, The people of the United Kingdom continued to make their mark on the landscape of the country, with elaborate burial mounds such as the ones at Sutton Hoo the treasures of which can now been see in the British museum. As time progressed waves of migrants and invaders came from the present day Germany, Denmark and Norway brought with them a new language and new culture.</p>

<p>1066 saw a major change in the history of the United Kingdom as the Kingdom of England was conquered by the Norman?s from Northern France. As a means to consolidate their power during the 11th and 12th centuries, they went on a building spree, building castles and churches, including the Tower of London and castles at <a href="/wiki/Windsor_and_Eton" title="Windsor and Eton">Windsor</a>, <a href="/wiki/Durham_(England)" title="Durham (England)">Durham</a> and <a href="/wiki/Warwick_(England)" title="Warwick (England)">Warwick</a> among others and wonderful cathedrals at <a href="/wiki/Canterbury_(England)" title="Canterbury (England)">Canterbury</a>, <a href="/wiki/Norwich" title="Norwich">Norwich</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lincoln" title="Lincoln">Lincoln</a>, Durham and <a href="/wiki/York" title="York">York</a>.

<p>The high cost of travelling basics such as transport, accommodation and food means that you will spend at least £50 per day as a budget traveller. This figure climbs higher if you want to use taxis, 3 star hotels, and eat in restaurants.</p>

<p>Cigarettes are heavily taxed ranging to over £7 for 20 cigarettes. 50-gram pouches of rolling tobacco are around £12. Imported brands such as Marlboro, Camel or Lucky Strike are generally the most expensive as are well-known UK brands such as Benson &amp; Hedges and Embassy. Popular and less pricey local brands include Lambert &amp; butler and Silk Cut (a light cigarette similar to Marlboro Light), while the cheapest brands (Mayfair, Richmond, Superking, Windsor Blue) are cheap and cheerful. Low-tar cigarettes cannot be called 'light' so terms such as 'gold' and 'smooth' are used. Most cigarettes come in low-tar and menthol variants, and many brands also sell 'Superking' (100mm length) variants too. The cheapest prices will be found in the supermarkets at the customer service counter. Almost all newsagents, supermarkets and petrol stations sell tobacco, and most will also sell some brands of pipe tobacco and cigars. For a more extensive selection of tobacco products, most towns and cities will have at least one specialist tobacconist. Be aware that new laws now require that tobacco products no longer be displayed, and so they may be seen by request only.</p>
<p>The minimum age to purchase tobacco is 18 however, smoking is legal at 16. Customers who appear younger than 18 (and, in some places, 21 or 25) may be asked to produce ID to prove they are aged 18 or over (passports, driving licences and cards bearing the PASS hologram are acceptable).</p>
<p>In some places there is a black market in considerably cheaper, imported cigarettes and you may be offered such in some pubs by certain individuals (rarely the publican or bar staff!). The health warning on these is likey to be in a language other than English. This is best avoided as this is indeed an illegal trade, and counterfeits are common.</p>
<p>Smoking is illegal in all enclosed public places with the exception of some hotel rooms (enquire when booking). For the purposes of the anti-smoking law, 'enclosed' is defined as having a minimum of three walls and a roof, so this can include things such as 'open' bus shelters. It is also illegal to smoke at railway stations. Penalties can include a £50 'on-the-spot' fine. Most pubs and nightclubs have smoking areas which fully comply with the relevant legislation.</p>

<p>The currency throughout the UK is the <b>Pound</b> (£) (more properly called the Pound Sterling, but this is not used in everyday speech), divided into 100 pence (p, pronounced 'pee').</p>
<p>Coins appear in 1p (small copper), 2p (large copper), 5p (very small silver), 10p (large silver), 20p (small silver with angled edges), 50p (large silver with angled edges), £1 (small, thick gold) and £2 (large, thick with silver centre and gold edge) denominations, while Bank of England notes (bills) come in £5 (green/light blue), £10 (orange/brown), £20 (blue (newer design) purple (older design)) and £50 (red), and depict the Queen on one side and famous historical figures on the other. The size increases according to value. It's often best to avoid getting £50 notes. £50 notes are often refused by smaller establishments - they are unpopular because of the risk of forgery, and because of the amount of change one needs to give on receiving one. Banks are also unlikely to change them to smaller notes for you, though a post office or bookmaker might.</p>
<p>However, Scottish and Northern Irish banks issue their own notes in the above denominations, with their own designs. If in doubt, check what you are given for the words "Pounds Sterling". £100 notes and some old £1 notes are also in circulation in Scotland. Bank of England notes circulate freely in the whole of the United Kingdom, and in Scotland and Northern Ireland it is quite common to receive change in a mixture of English and/or Scottish or Northern Irish notes. Welsh banks do not issue their own notes.</p>
<p>Some smaller English or Welsh vendors might refuse to accept notes issued by Scottish or Northern Irish banks mainly due to unfamiliarity. They are under no obligation to do so, so use them at a larger retailer, or change them for Bank of England notes at a bank. There should never be a charge for this - though foreign-exchange dealers at airports or ferry terminals might well try to charge you.</p>
<p>Coins are uniform throughout the United Kingdom. Non-English speaking visitors should be aware that the new coin designs (introduced from 2008) no longer show the value in numbers, only words.</p>
<p>You may will also hear the slang term <b>quid</b> for pounds. It is both singular and plural; "three quid" means "three pounds". It is likely that people will use the slang "p" when they mean either a penny or pence. Note the singular is penny and the plural pence. Some people still use traditional terms such as a penny, tuppence and thruppence (1p, 2p and 3p). The words "Fiver" and "Tenner" are common slang for £5 and £10, respectively.</p>
<p>In general, shopkeepers and other businesses in the UK are not obliged to accept any particular money or other method of payment. Any offer to purchase can simply be refused; for example if you try to pay with notes or coins they don't recognise, or if you try to pay with a note of substantially higher value than what you are purchasing (bus drivers are renowned for refusing notes). If in doubt, ask someone when you enter the shop. If settling a debt, for example, paying a restaurant or hotel bill, usually any reasonable method of payment will be accepted unless it's been made clear to you in advance how you must pay. Travellers cheques in Sterling may accepted in place of cash but it is best to ask first.</p>
<p>ATMs, which are often known in the UK as Cashpoints, cash machines or informally as 'holes in the wall', are very widely available and usually dispense £10, £20 and sometimes £5 notes. Traveller's cheques can be exchanged at most banks. Be aware: some non-bank ATMs (easily identified, sometimes kiosk-style units, as opposed to fixed units in walls, and often at petrol/gas stations and convenience stores) charge a fixed fee for withdrawing money, and your home bank may as well. On average the cost is about £1.75 per withdrawal, but the machine will always inform you of this and allow you to cancel the transaction.</p>
<p>Visa, MasterCard, Maestro and American Express are accepted by most shops and restaurants, although American Express is sometimes not accepted by smaller independent establishments, and it is worth asking if unsure, especially if there are long queues. Internet purchases from a UK-based merchant with a credit card however usually incurs a 2-2.5% surcharge (this does not apply to a debit card). Since 14 February 2006, Chip and PIN <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.chipandpin.co.uk/">[77]</a> has become nearly compulsory, with few companies still accepting signatures when paying by credit or debit cards. Customers from countries without chips in their credit cards are supposed to be able to sign instead of providing a PIN; however, it is wise to carry enough cash in case the retailer does not comply.</p>
<p>Although most small shops will take cards, there is often a minimum amount you have to spend (usually around £5). Anything under the minimum and they may refuse to accept the card, or charge a fee to process the payment.</p>

<p>Although shopping in the UK can be expensive, it is generally regarded as a world-class destination for shoppers both in terms of variety and quality of products, depending on where and what you buy. Fierce competition has brought prices down considerably in the food, clothing and electronic sectors. Prices do vary and it is always worth visiting the various retail stores as bargains can often be found. Avoid buying from the tourist areas and stick to the High Street shops or the many 'out-of-town' retail parks where prices will be considerably cheaper. The retail market in the UK is a very competitive one and many bargains are to be had all year round. In the electronics sector, for example, it is becoming more and more common to ask for a price reduction at time of purchase.</p>
<p>VAT (Value Added Tax - a mandatory tax on almost all goods and services in the UK) is 20% with reduced rates of 5% and 0% applying to specific categories of goods (food from supermarkets and some books, for example, are taxed at 0%). For most High Street shopping, VAT is included in the sale price. However, for certain larger purchases, especially in the area of computers and electronics, stores may show prices without VAT, however these are clearly marked with "exc VAT" next to the figure. In many of the larger towns and cities, many shops have the blue "Tax-Free Shopping" sticker in the window, meaning that when you leave the European Union (not just the UK), you can claim back the VAT before you leave the country. However, in order to do this, you must keep any receipts you receive from your purchase.</p>
<p>Electronic items such as computers and digital cameras can be cheaper here than many European countries (especially Scandinavian countries), but do shop around. The internet is always a good way to judge the price of a particular item, also you can use this as a bargaining tool when agreeing on a price with some of the larger electronic retail stores. If visiting from the US, there may be duties and taxes charged that make some of these purchases much less of a bargain so shop wisely.</p>

<p>Despite jokes and stereotypes, British food is actually very good and has improved greatly over the past few decades, and the British remain extremely proud of their native dishes. Restaurants and supermarkets in the middle and upper range have consistently high standards, and the choice of international dishes is among the best in Europe. However, British eating culture is still in the middle of a transition phase. Unlike their continental neighbours, many Britons still eat to live rather than living to eat, and as a result, food quality is variable at the budget end of the market. Moreover, as Britain is a culturally diverse nation, many different kinds of food are available due to the influence of immigration.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom can be an expensive place to eat out compared to, say, the more southern European countries, but relatively cheap in comparison with countries such as Switzerland and Norway.</p>
<p>Many restaurants in city centres tend to be a little more expensive than ones in the suburbs, and pubs do tend to be slightly more expensive in the countryside, but generally, a three-course meal without drinks will cost the traveller anywhere between £10 and £25. Chicken tikka masala with rice is sometimes claimed as the UK's most popular dish, though roast beef is a more traditional national dish.</p>
<p>If all else fails decent picnic foods such as sandwiches, cakes, crisps, fresh fruit, cheeses and drinks are readily available at supermarkets. Street markets are a good place to pick up fresh fruit and local cheeses at bargain prices. Bakeries (e.g. Greggs) and supermarkets ( e.g. Tesco, Sainsburys, Waitrose, Morrisons and Asda) usually sell a good selection of pre-packed sandwiches, pasties and cakes along with a range of soft drinks, juices and mineral waters. In addition, most chemists and newsagents will have a basic supply of pre-packaged sandwiches and bottled drinks.</p>
<p>Many large shops, especially department stores, will have a coffee shop or restaurant.</p>
<p>Smoking is now banned in <i>all</i> restaurants, cafés, bars and pubs - there are no exceptions. However some establishments have provided 'smoking areas' and smoking is allowed in the gardens/terraces outside pubs and restaurants unless otherwise stated.</p>

Fish &amp; Chips, a quintessentially British dish</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Deep-fried, battered fish (usually cod or haddock, though with a wider selection in some areas) with rather thick chips, always made from real chunks of potato rather than thin tubes of extruded mashed potato. Fish and chips are often served with mushy peas (in England), and dressed with salt and malt vinegar (or 'Sauce' in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland). "Proper" (authentic, for-the-masses) fish and chips can be bought only from either a backstreet "chippy" or a specialist fish and chip restaurant (the latter are mostly at the seaside, although there is a national chain, Harry Ramsden's, which does quite good fish and chips, but at "tourist prices"; Mr Ramsden's original shop, near Leeds, was a legend). However, a "proper chippy" (a backstreet "fish and chip shop", or just "chip shop") is the quintessential place to buy fish and chips. In the north you can also add mushy peas to your order. These are rarer in the south of the country. In Scotland, especially Glasgow, some fish and chip shops deep-fry almost everything they sell, including meat pies, pizzas, and even battered Mars or Snickers bars. In Northern Ireland, you can also order a <i>Pastie</i> (not to be confused with a <i>Cornish Pasty</i>). This is meat minced with onions, potato and spices, which is then battered and deep fried. It can be served in a <i>bap</i> (a soft bread bun), on its own, or with chips. Anything served with chips in Northern Ireland and in parts of Scotland is referred to as a "supper", e.g., "a fish supper" or "a pastie supper".</p>
<p>The best ones are specialists, serving perhaps a few alternatives such as a selection of pies or sausages. They are usually located near where people live, though some good ones, especially "sit down" chippies, can be found in town centres. They can be spotted by the illuminated sign which usually has a picture of a fish and a name: either punning and piscine, such as "Codroephenia" and "The Codfather" or proud and proprietarial, "Fred's Chippy", or even both as in "Jack's Golden Plaice". Typically a lot of people eating or waiting is an indication of good food.</p>
<p>A "sit down chippy" is a chip shop with a separate dining room. Whilst no real one will be exactly like this, although most elements will be present, a stereotypical sit down chippie will be brightly lit and decorated in a nautical theme with yellow or blue formica-topped tables. Typically a waitress will take your order for a Cod Meal, alternatively Haddock, Plaice or another dish, and within five minutes your meal will be served: a huge fish, a mountain of chips and mushy peas. Accompanying it, in more up-market places, will be a sachet of tartar sauce, a slice of lemon, a big plate of bread-and-butter, and a pot of tea. Some will have a separate pot of hot water, either to dilute the tea if it is too strong for your taste, or to "top-up" the tea in the pot when you have poured out your first cup. On the table will be a large shaker of salt and a bottle or plastic squeezy bottle of brown malt vinegar, which is what most British will put on their fish and chips. There may even be a tomato-shaped plastic container of ketchup or a container of <i>brown sauce</i>. Fish and chips bought from a pub, hotel or non-specialist restaurant bear little resemblance to those from a chippy.</p>

<p>A 'take-away' is either a shop supplying prepared meals for people to eat elsewhere, or the meal itself. A very British take-away is the Fish and Chip shop; the sandwich shop is a popular choice at lunchtimes; they often also sell pies and cakes. Alternatively, most towns and many main routes have a selection of fast-food chains. Various types of take-aways are present in nearly all towns, ranging from fish and chips to "Indian", which can often be operated by non-Indians like Bangladeshi, and Chinese shops. Thai and Indonesian takeaways are becoming quite common, and lots of others in bigger towns. Generally the standard of take-aways is good, but the best guide is, as always, to observe what the locals are doing. In towns and cities these places tend to open late (sometimes till about 1AM) to cater for the so-called after-the-pub crowd. At this time they tend to be busy and rowdy so to avoid the queues the best time for a takeaway is between 7PM and 11PM after the teatime rush but before the supper crowds.</p>

<p>See below for general points about pubs. Pubs are typically places where you can sample British cuisine. There are no such things as a British restaurant <i>per se</i>, so these will be your next best bet; even if you are against drinking alcohol, you will find a more traditional and full menu then a cafe or chippy.</p>
<p>Almost all pubs (see below) serve food, although not all will do so during the whole of their opening hours. Prices of all these types vary enormously, and you should seek local advice if you have particular requirements or standards. Do not sit at a table in a pub expecting a waiter to take your order for food or drinks: pubs nearly always work on a "queue at the bar for drinks: order at the bar for food" basis. You go to the bar to request and pay for drinks and food. To avoid annoying customers behind them, groups usually order as one, and "settle up" between themselves later (see elsewhere for "buying rounds"). You normally order your "starters" and "mains" together (food-oriented places have numbers screwed to the tables for you to quote, or will give you a number to take to your table). There is an etiquette that if you see another patron at the bar, you should invite them to order first. You then wait for your drinks to be poured and carry them to the table. When your meal is ready, it is either brought to you or, less commonly now, announced when it is ready for you to collect. The person who tidies away your main course may ask you what dessert you would like, or you may have to order at the bar again.</p>

<p>Larger towns have a range of restaurants to suit most tastes and you will find a very broad range of cuisines, including Indian, Chinese, Thai, French and Italian. Waiters generally expect a 10% tip (but all too often do not get it from the native population) and in some places this is automatically listed on your bill. However, if you are dissatisfied with the service in any way, you are under no obligation to pay the service charge. Generally British people are not great tippers. As a visitor the 10% rule is more than generous and worth sticking to. Visitors from The US and Canada are seen as very generous tippers and even a bit of a soft touch by some.</p>
<p>The usual fast-food restaurants (McDonalds, Burger King, Pizza Hut, KFC, Subway and local chain Wimpy) are widespread in larger towns and cities but uncommon in smaller towns. They are typically located in major shopping areas, in or around major train stations, in out-of-town retail parks and in motorway service stations and airports (the latter 2 are usually more expensive). Prices are average - a burger, chips and drink meal will cost about £4-5. Most are open from around 7:00-22:00 although some in large cities are 24-hours. Fast-food restaurants in out-of-town locations offer drive-through service. Delivery service is widely offered.</p>

<p>One of the most popular types of restaurant in the UK is the Indian restaurant. They can be found in every city and most towns large and small. There are now more and more upmarket Indian restaurants in the larger urban centres. Indian restaurants serve cuisine commonly known to their customers by the generic term "curry". Common Indian restaurant dishes include Chicken Tikka Masala, Prawn Biryani and the incredibly spicy Vindaloo. A popular version of curry is known as balti, possibly named after the metal bowl the food is cooked and served in. Balti cuisine, and a number of other commonly served dishes such as the ubiquitous chicken tikka masala, originated in the UK though it is clearly based on food from the Indian subcontinent. Birmingham in the Midlands is considered the balti capital of the UK as this dish was conceived there. <b>Curry Mile</b> in <a href="/wiki/Manchester" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> is well worth a visit if you are in the city.</p>

<p>Motorway service areas are notoriously expensive places to eat, though the vast majority are open 24 hours by law. Most contain fast-food outlets and all have (free) toilets. Some services may be limited overnight such as the range of hot and cold food, although most will keep a selection available. Service areas are often best avoided as it is often possible to find cheaper and much better places to eat within a mile or two of a motorway junction. They have a poor reputation for hygiene and service; subsequently places like Little Chef have taken such a hit that many have closed. Try 5 minutes away <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.5minutesaway.co.uk/">[78]</a>, a website listing facilities no more than 5 minutes' drive from motorway junctions.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Vegetarian.2Fvegan">Vegetarian/vegan</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=78" title="Edit section: Vegetarian/vegan">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Vegetarianism has become more widespread in the UK over the last few decades. If you are staying as a guest in a British home it would be considered courteous to inform your host beforehand as to any dietary requirements, but this will not be considered rude or even particularly unusual. If you are staying in a B&amp;B, let the owner know when you arrive, and you'll often find that they will cook up a special vegetarian breakfast for you.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that even if you call yourself vegetarian some people will assume you eat fish, so if you don't, then tell them so. Nowadays, it is rare to find a pub or restaurant with no vegetarian options.</p>
<p>If you are a vegan, be prepared to explain precisely what you do and don't eat on a fairly frequent basis. Outside of specialist eateries, most places probably won't have a vegan-friendly main meal, so be prepared to hunt around, order bits and bobs, or in a pub make do with the ubiquitous bowl of chips and tomato ketchup and even then it would be wise to check whether the chips have been cooked in animal fat, a practice quickly falling out of fashion.</p>
<p>In general, the best places for vegetarian and vegan food are specialist veggie pubs and restaurants and Indian, Chinese and South-East Asian restaurants. Most major cities and towns will have at least one. Expensive upscale restaurants may have more limited vegetarian options, and sometimes none at all. If you're fortunate enough to be dining in such a place, it may be worth ringing ahead.</p>

<p>Children are not necessarily allowed in all pubs and restaurants unless a lounge area is provided, and high chairs are not always available. Most pubs that serve food will accept children, and it is usually easy to distinguish those that do. The general rule is that children cannot sit or stand about in the area where drinks are being served; so if the pub has only one small room, they are not allowed. Children are permitted in most drinks-only pubs, especially those with gardens, but again, they are not supposed to come near the bar. To be safe, ask an employee or telephone the place in advance.</p>

<ul><li><b>Black Pudding</b> - a sausage made of congealed pig's blood or, in the <a href="/wiki/Western_Isles" title="Western Isles" class="mw-redirect">Western Isles</a> of Scotland, sheep's blood, rusks and sage or spices, cooked in an intestine.

In actual fact, it tastes much better than it sounds.</li>
</ul><ul><li><b>Cheese</b> - Although the British are not as famous for, or as proud of, their cheeses as their neighbours in France, a multitude of cheeses are produced and are generally named after a particular region. Well-known examples include <a href="/wiki/Caerphilly" title="Caerphilly">Caerphilly</a>; Cheddar, named after the village of <a href="/wiki/Cheddar" title="Cheddar">Cheddar</a> in <a href="/wiki/Somerset_(England)" title="Somerset (England)">Somerset</a>; <a href="/wiki/Cheshire" title="Cheshire">Cheshire</a>; <a href="/wiki/Lancashire" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, which may be "creamy" or "crumbly"; Stilton (named after <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.stilton.org/">Stilton</a> but now produced elsewhere) - a blue cheese to rival Roquefort or Gorgonzola and <a href="/wiki/Yorkshire_Dales#Wensleydale" title="Yorkshire Dales">Wensleydale</a>, named after a valley in <a href="/wiki/North_Yorkshire" title="North Yorkshire">North Yorkshire</a>. The quality varies tremendously, depending on where they are bought; the best place is probably a local market ? so you might want to actually buy your Lancashire cheese in Lancashire. Supermarkets will offer a wide range of cheeses but are often of inferior quality.</li>
<li><b>Cornish Pasty</b> - beef and vegetables baked in a folded pastry case. Originally a speciality of <a href="/wiki/Cornwall" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, but now available throughout the UK. Usually very good in Devon and Cornwall, but can be of variable quality elsewhere. The variety sold in a plastic wrapper in places like filling stations and motorway service stations are well worth avoiding. As of 2011, Cornish Pasties can only be labelled as Cornish if they are made in Cornwall.</li>
<li><b>Deep Fried Mars Bar</b> - Originally from <a href="/wiki/Stonehaven" title="Stonehaven">Stonehaven</a>, Kincardineshire, but now available in other parts of <a href="/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> and sometimes by request in fish &amp; chip shops elsewhere in the UK. Not usually available in south-east England, where they are sometimes believed to be an urban myth.</li>
<li><b>Eccles Cake</b> - a popular flaky-pastry type cake with raisins, from the small namesake town in Lancashire.</li>
<li><b>Haggis</b> - a mixture of sheep innards, minced meat and oatmeal boiled in a sheep's stomach. Available widely, but a speciality of <a href="/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>. Also available in many supermarkets, where it appears that many sheep have plastic stomachs - although the contents are often quite reasonable - sometimes mildly spicy.</li>
<li><b>Lancashire Hotpot</b> - a hearty vegetable and meat stew. A speciality of <a href="/wiki/Lancashire" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, but available throughout the UK. In Lancashire, it is often accompanied by pickled red cabbage or pickled beetroot.</li>
<li><b>Laverbread</b> (Welsh: <i>bara lafwr</i> or <i>bara lawr</i>) - a purée made from seaweed, rolled in oatmeal, lightly fried and generally served with bacon rashers, although it can also be prepared as a vegetarian dish. Available in <a href="/wiki/Swansea" title="Swansea">Swansea</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wales" title="Wales">West Wales</a>.</li>

Not to be confused with the Scottish oatcake, a sort of biscuit.</li>
<li>The <b>Pastie</b> peculiar to <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> should not be confused with the type of <i>Pasty</i> associated with Cornwall and common throughout Britain. Recipes vary, but generally a pastie is minced pork with onions, potato and spices, shaped into a thick disc, covered with batter and deep fried. Pasties are unique to Northern Ireland and well worth trying from a Fish &amp; Chip shop.</li>
<li><b>Pork pie</b> - a pie made of pork, with an outer crust made of a particularly crispy sort of pastry. <a href="/wiki/Melton_Mowbray" title="Melton Mowbray">Melton Mowbray</a> in <a href="/wiki/Leicestershire" title="Leicestershire">Leicestershire</a> is their spiritual home but they are available across the country. They are served cold or at room temperature as part of a cold meal.</li>
<li><b>Potato Bread</b> - a mixture of potatoes, salt, butter and flour. A speciality of <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> which, alongside Sodabread forms one of the main ingredients of an 'Ulster Fry'. Similar to, but not quite the same as potato bread, are <b>Potato Cakes</b> as sold in <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a> and <b>Tattie Scones</b> in <a href="/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>.</li>
<li><b>Sausages</b> - Europeans will be surprised to discover that the filling contains breadcrumbs, rusk or other fillers as well as meat (Britons think of frankfurters and similar solid-meat sausages as German or French). Generic sausages are nothing special and very much a 'mystery meat' experience, that being said not all sausages are pork, with many now seeing a mix with beef, venison, turkey or even soya. Regional speciality recipes such as Lincolnshire and the Cumberland-ring are well worth trying in a pub. Some marketplaces and butchers still serve archaic family recipes, such as Oxford where the sausage is without skin and more like a beef patty. Remember you get what you pay for. 2p or 3p 'bargain' bangers like Walls will taste of very little.</li>
<li><b>Sunday dinner/Roast dinner</b> - this meal is common throughout the UK. Traditionally eaten on a Sunday, the meal consists of a roasted joint of meat (eg: Whole roast chicken, leg of lamb, shoulder of pork, etc.), and roast potatoes and steamed/boiled vegetables. All served with gravy (a thick or thin sauce, depending on the meat, made with the meat juices and stock. Yorkshire Pudding (a pancake style batter baked in a very hot oven) is traditionally served with roast beef, although some people have it with any roast dinner.</li>
<li><b>Smoked fish</b> - protected as a regional dish from the greater <a href="/wiki/Grimsby" title="Grimsby">Grimsby</a> area. Usually haddock is the most popular type smoked in this special style. In Scotland, it is traditional to have smoked kippers if not porridge for breakfast.</li>
<li><b>Welsh Cakes</b> - scone-like cakes studded with raisins and dusted with sugar. Available in bakeries throughout <a href="/wiki/Wales" title="Wales">Wales</a> and served hot off the griddle at <a href="/wiki/Swansea" title="Swansea">Swansea</a> Market.</li>
<li><b>Yorkshire Pudding</b> - a savoury side dish made from unsweetened batter. Traditionally a plate-sized pudding would be served with gravy before the main course, to encourage more economical consumption of expensive meat. Squat and round in shape - often served with a roast dinner (consisting of roast potatoes, roast beef and Yorkshire puddings). Originally a speciality of the former industrial cities of <a href="/wiki/Yorkshire" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>, but now an integral part of a beef dinner throughout the UK.</li>

<p>The legal age to buy alcohol or consume it in a pub is 18, but many teenagers younger than 18 have seemingly little problem in purchasing alcohol in smaller pubs and from off licences. Nevertheless, if you're over 18 but lucky enough to look younger, expect to be asked to prove your age when buying alcohol (also, in certain places if you look under 21 or 25, you have to prove you're over 18, known as "Challenge 21(25)"), especially in popular city spots. Some premises will require proof of age for all drinks after a certain time of night due to restrictions on the age of people who can be on the premises. The most trustworthy form of ID is a passport or driving licence which shows both your photograph and date of birth. ID cards are likely to be accepted (providing there is a photograph) and proof of age cards are available which must be applied for by post and take several weeks to issue. Any other form of ID willl not be accepted. In private residences the minimum age to drink alcohol is 5 years old, although it is likely that if a 5 or 6 year old etc. were getting drunk, the matter would be brought before the courts as child neglect.</p>
<p>Getting drunk is acceptable and often it is the objective of a party, though the police often take a dim view on those causing alcohol-related trouble. This applies to all levels of the British society - it may be worth remembering that the former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, had to collect his son Euan from a police station after he had been found drunk celebrating the completion of his GCSE exams taken at the age of 16. Nevertheless, Britons have a great sense of humour and everything is forgotten after a hangover, at least until the next time. Drinking is an important part of the British culture and, even though it is frequently complained about, it is as popular as ever.</p>
<p>Urinating in public is illegal, anti-social and quite difficult to explain when applying for a visa. You should try and use the facilities where you are drinking.</p>

A traditional English pub</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <b>pub</b> or public house is the most popular place to get a drink in the UK. Even small villages will often have a pub, serving spirits, wines, beers, cider, 'alcopops' and non-alcoholic drinks, accompanied by crisps, nuts and pork scratchings. Many serve snacks or meals. The greater volume of drinks served are various kinds of beer, mainly lagers, bitters, and porter / stout (i.e. Guinness). People not looking to drink <i>real ale</i> are free to choose a pub just on the basis of location, and character, because most national "smooth" bitters or TV-advertised lagers are available in any non-real-ale pub; however, even non-real-ale drinkers often find that they prefer the types of pubs with a range of real ales, because they tend to be more "traditional", with a more individual character and less oriented to juke boxes, games machines, fruit machines and large crowds.</p>
<p>Across the whole of the United Kingdom there is now a blanket ban on smoking inside pubs and restaurants, though many pubs have areas outside, often known as "beer gardens", where smoking is (usually, but not always) permissible. However if you are lucky (or unlucky) enough to be able to stay after the formal closing hours this is called a "lock-in" and smoking may be ok if the pub landlord allows it. This will often occur only in the later hours after 11PM and these lock-ins can last any amount of time. As they are classed as a private party, they happen in only a few pubs, and often only pubs with more regular customers, although this is not always the case. Once at a lock-in, you cannot leave and come back in again.</p>
<p>British <b>real ales</b>, championed by the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.camra.org.uk/">[79]</a>, are among the best in the world - though people used to colder, blander, fizzier beers may find that the taste needs to be acquired. People looking for real ale will need to select the right pubs, because although a wide range of pubs serve one or two real ales, only a "real ale pub" will have a wide selection. British ale has a limited shelf life compared to most foreign beers, and as some pubs have only a "token" cask with low turnover, it's often well past its prime and has a strange vinegary taste: often, unfortunately, people's first and understandably only experience with "real ale". If you do receive an 'off' pint, ask for a replacement at the bar, which will usually be forthcoming.</p>
<p>The phrase "free house" was usually the main indicator for people looking for a good choice of beer, because this indicated that the pub was not owned by a particular brewery and served whatever beer its landlord thought would appeal to their customers. However, this is no longer a significant factor, because most national pub chains are now owned by large conglomerates who deal centrally with brewers and serve the same mass-market brands in all their pubs: these conglomerates (not being breweries) can still call their pubs "free houses".</p>
<p>British people usually follow a kind of unwritten code of conduct when in pubs, though types of venue can vary dramatically, ranging from a 'local' pub, usually a quiet place consisting of one or two rooms, to a chain pub such as J.D. Wetherspoons which are very large rooms capable of holding hundreds of people.</p>
<ul><li>Don't tap money on the bar surface to attract the barman's attention.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Tipping is not a tradition in most pubs and you should take all of your change. Regular customers who have a relationship with the staff will offer to buy the landlord, or bar worker, a drink. They may say something like this: "A pint of Best, landlord, and one for yourself." The landlord will often keep the money rather than have too much to drink. However, you are not obliged to do this yourself.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Especially in a 'local' pub, keep your voice down and avoid drawing attention to yourself.</li>
</ul><ul><li>It might be best to avoid heated debates about controversial subjects in pubs and bars; if others get involved these can escalate.</li>
</ul><ul><li>If you require extra chairs, you may want to take one from another table. If someone is already seated (even if it is only one person seated at a six-person table) you <i>must</i> ask if you can take the chair.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Waiting patiently at a bar is imperative. Pushing in line will not be tolerated and could lead to confrontation. If someone cuts in line before you, feel free to complain - you should get support from other locals around you. Bear in mind that pubs are among the few places in Britain which don't actually have formal queues?you just crowd around the bar, and when everyone who was there before you has been served you can order. Depending on the environment, if a barman offers to serve you but the person next to you has been waiting longer, you should advise the barman to serve the person next to you.</li>
</ul><ul><li>In the male toilets, especially in big pubs or clubs, don't try to strike up conversation or make prolonged eye contact. UK pub toilets are very much "get in and get out" places - some drunk people can take a casual remark the wrong way.</li>
</ul><p>Pubs with a good choice of real ales may exhibit almost any pattern of ownership:</p>

A Scottish pub</div>
</div>
</div>
<ul><li>By a real-ale brewery (in which case the pub will serve all of the beers made by them, and perhaps only one "guest beer").</li>
</ul><ul><li>By a national or local pub chain who believe it is possible to serve a range of real ales at reasonable prices (their chain buying power can force down a brewer's margins) in a pub that non-real-ale-fans will be willing to patronise.</li>
</ul><ul><li>By an independent landlord committed to real ale (usually the ones with the most idiosyncratic beers, and the hard-core "real ale type" customers).</li>
</ul><p>Many pubs are very old and have traditional names, such as the "Red Lion" or "King's Arms"; before widespread literacy, pubs would be identified by most customers solely by their signs. Recently there has been a trend, strongly resisted in some quarters, towards chain-pubs such as the Hogshead, Slug and Lettuce and those owned by the JD Wetherspoon company. Another recent trend is the <i><b>gastro pub</b></i>, a smartened-up traditional pub with a selection of high-quality food (nearly at restaurant prices).</p>
<p>Beer in pubs is served in <b>pint</b> and <b>half-pint</b> measures, or in bottles. A pint is slightly more than half a litre (568ml to be precise). Simply ordering a beer on tap will be interpreted as a request for a pint, e.g. 'a lager, please'. Alternatively 'half a lager, please' will get you a half-pint. If you ask for a "half-pint of lager" in a noisy pub, you will almost certainly get a pint, because no-one asks for a "half-pint" and the bar person will have thought you said "I'll have a pint of lager, please". Prices vary widely based on the city, the pub and the beer, but generally pints will be in the range £3 to £4.</p>
<p>Spirits and shorts are normally 25 ml although some pubs use a standard 35ml measure, in all cases it will be clearly indicated on the optic, in England, Scotland and Wales. In Northern Ireland, the standard measure is a 35ml measure. A <i>dram</i> in Scotland was traditionally a quarter of a gill measure now 25ml.</p>
<p>Pubs often serve food during the day. Drinks are ordered and paid for at the bar.</p>
<p>When applying for a licence, pubs can specify any opening times they wish; this can be challenged by neighbours, etc. Closing times are typically the 'last order' time - the pub can sell drinks before this and customers have to drink up and leave within 20 minutes of the licensing hours.</p>
<p>Until the recent change in licensing laws, closing times were 11PM and 10:30PM on a Sunday, and this is still quite common. The most common closing times at the weekends in towns are between midnight and 1AM, and some larger pubs may apply for a licence until 2AM and clubs 3AM or 4AM. It is not unheard of that some bars have licences until the early hours (6AM) although this is rare as many who are out until this time are likely to go to nightclubs and then home. Theoretically, a pub can ask for a 24-hour licence, though few have done so.</p>

<p>In cities, in additional to traditional pubs, there are more modern <b>wine-bars</b> and <b>café-bars</b> (often known simply as <b>bars</b>), though the variable weather means that there is not as much of a 'street scene' as in other European cities. However, depending on the weather, there are more and more pavement cafés in the UK than in the past. Parts of London, Manchester and other up-and-coming cities are good examples of this change of scene.</p>
<p>Prices in bars tend to be higher than in pubs, with less focus on beer, and more on wine, spirits and cocktails. Customers are often younger than those of traditional pubs, though there is much crossover and some bars are more "pubby" than others.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Clubbing">Clubbing</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=84" title="Edit section: Clubbing">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p><b>Clubbing</b> is popular in most large towns and cities, and many have world-renowned venues as well as many alternative venues. Great clubs can be found in London, Glasgow, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Edinburgh, Newcastle and Brighton to name just a few places. Prices in clubs tend to be considerably higher than those charged in pubs, and opening hours may not be the attraction they once were, as pubs can now open late too. Most clubs will not admit anyone under 18. ID may be asked for at the door, but ID checks at bars are less common. Dress codes are sometimes applied by doormen or bouncers before entry, sometimes none-too-consistently. Common dress codes are simply to dress smartly and avoid wearing sports wear, including trainers. However "fashion" trainers, especially dark coloured ones are increasingly accepted when part of smart attire. That said, some upmarket clubs will still insist on shoes and if in doubt, wear shoes to avoid being turned away.</p>
<p>Clubs are often cheaper during the week (Mon-Thu) as many of these nights are designed to cater for students; however, you usually have to pay an entrance fee. For a club in a small town (capacity 250-300) this will usually be £1-£2 on week night, £2-£3 on weekends, and seldom more than £5 on special occasions. Conventional clubs in bigger towns and alternative clubs in cities will cost anywhere between £5 and £10. Large clubs, especially those in cities, that cater for a "dance" crowd will almost certainly cost over £10, though seldom more than £15. For towns with a large student population, it is often much cheaper to go clubbing during week nights (Monday-Thursday), as many clubs advertise towards students on these nights, offering discounted drinks and cheaper entry.</p>

<p>Tea is widely drunk in the UK, most British people drink black tea with milk and/or sugar. Tea drinking is common in Britain as India, which is one country where tea trees are found, was a British territory until 1947.</p>
<p>Coffee is also popular in the UK but not as popular as tea.</p>

<p>The UK offers a wide variety of <b>hotels</b> rated on a scale of stars, from 5-star luxury (and beyond!) to 1-star basic. There is also a vast number of privately run <b>bed and breakfast</b> establishments (abbreviated as "B&amp;B"), offering rooms with usually a fried 'full English breakfast'. Alternatively you can rent a private house which is let as a holiday home; many such holiday homes advertise on a wide variety of free websites or advertise on their own websites. Good deals can usually be found by using a search engine for "self-catering holiday accommodation".</p>

<p>The UK has been a centre of learning for the past 1,000 years and possesses many ancient and distinguished universities. Many former polytechnics and other colleges have been promoted to university status over the past 25 years, and there are now over 120 degree-awarding institutions in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The two most famous (and oldest) universities are <b>Oxford</b> and <b>Cambridge</b> (often referred to as Oxbridge by many Britons), but <b>England</b> also has several other world-class institutions, including several in <b>London</b> (notably <b>Imperial College</b>, the <b>London School of Economics</b>, <b>University College London</b> and <b>King's College London</b>, all are part of London University). Outside of London in England the top universities are located in <b>Durham</b>, <b>Birmingham</b>, <b>Manchester</b>, <b>Liverpool</b>, <b>Exeter</b>, <b>Leeds</b>, <b>Sheffield</b>, <b>Bristol</b>, <b>York</b>, <b>Nottingham</b>, <b>Kent</b>, <b>Bath</b>, <b>Loughborough</b>, <b>Newcastle</b>, <b>Southampton</b> and <b>Warwick</b>.</p>
<p><b>Scotland</b> has its own semi-separate educational system, with universities in <b>Aberdeen</b> (Aberdeen and Robert Gordon), <b>Dundee</b> (Dundee and Abertay), <b>Edinburgh</b> (Edinburgh, Napier, Queen Margaret and Heriot-Watt), <b>Glasgow</b> (Glasgow, Strathclyde and Caledonian), <b>Stirling</b> and the oldest and most traditional one at <b>St Andrews</b>.</p>
<p>There are two universities in <b>Northern Ireland</b>: the Queen's University of Belfast, and the University of Ulster (which has campuses in Belfast, Jordanstown, Coleraine and Londonderry). Although Queen's is the older and more famous institution, both are highly respected throughout the UK as centres of excellence.</p>
<p>Traditionally the University of <b>Wales</b> comprised four large universities: <a href="/wiki/Aberystwyth" title="Aberystwyth">Aberystwyth</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.aber.ac.uk/">[84]</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bangor_(Wales)" title="Bangor (Wales)">Bangor</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bangor.ac.uk/index.php.en?width=1024&amp;height=768">[85]</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cardiff" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/index.html">[86]</a> and <a href="/wiki/Swansea" title="Swansea">Swansea</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www2.swan.ac.uk/">[87]</a>, but since many polytechnics and institutes were upgraded to university status the number of Welsh universities has increased.</p>
<p>Regardless of which university you attend, all British universities are required to maintain certain minimum academic standards by the British government in order for them to be allowed to award academic degrees.</p>
<p>Foreign students make up a significant proportion of the student body at UK universities, with over 300,000 foreign students in 2004. All undergraduate applications go through a central body UCAS <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://ucas.com/">[88]</a>, which acts as a clearing house passing applications to the universities for consideration and feeding their decisions back to applicants. Course fees for overseas students vary considerably, costing significantly more for the prestigious institutions. In addition, international students are generally charged higher fees than British and other European Union students. For postgraduate applications, applicants will have to apply directly with the institution.</p>
<p>In order to study in the UK, unless you are a citizen of the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a>, <a href="/wiki/Norway" title="Norway">Norway</a>, <a href="/wiki/Iceland" title="Iceland">Iceland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Liechtenstein" title="Liechtenstein">Liechtenstein</a> or <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, you will need to get either a student visitor for a 6-month course or a Tier 4 visa for something longer. In the case of the latter, you must have a confirmation of acceptance of studies from the institution, take an English Proficiency Exam (preferably the IELTS but this may be waived if you are a national of or took your previous education in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/studying/adult-students/can-you-apply/english-language/"><b>a majority English-speaking country</b></a>) and demonstrate that you have sufficient funds available to you for the duration of your course. Most importantly, students on a Tier 4 must be enrolled full-time in an entire course of study, they cannot come just to study individual modules.</p>
<p>The UK - London, Manchester and Edinburgh in particular - remains an exceedingly popular destination for those seeking to learn the English language. A huge variety of organisations and companies exist to cater for this desire, some much more reputable than others:</p>

<p>Citizens of the European Union (temporarily excluding Romania and Bulgaria), Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland have permanent work rights in the UK. In general, the citizens of other countries will require a visa to work in the UK. The UK has had low unemployment in recent years, making it easier for those with specialist skills to gain working visas. A general shortage of skilled labour in the health sector means the British health service actively recruits abroad, making it easier for those with specialist health care skills to work in the UK. This however may change due to the large investment the British government has made into getting more nurses and doctors trained from the United Kingdom. There continues to be a severe shortage in dentists, with many British people travelling to Hungary or Poland for dental treatment.</p>
<p>Beware that <i>all work</i>, paid or unpaid, requires a non-EU/EEA/Swiss citizen to hold a visa with work permit in order to take part (tourist or visitor visas do not qualify). This includes, strangely, volunteer work.</p>
<p>Citizens of Australia, Canada, Hong Kong (British National (Overseas) passport holders only), Japan, Monaco, New Zealand, South Korea and Taiwan (as well as British overseas citizens and British overseas territories citizens) can apply for a Tier 5 visa under the Youth Mobility Scheme, which lasts 2 years and permits the holder to work.</p>
<p>Young people of other nationalities may be able to work on internships in the UK by applying for a Tier 5 visa under the Government-sponsored exchange category. Organisations such as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.iepuk.com/">IEPUK</a> can help to sponsor and assist a young people from aboard to applying for such a visa.</p>
<p>Most holders of a student visa are permitted to work for up to 20 hours a week during term-time and an<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/studying/adult-students/conditions/">unlimited number of hours outside term-time</a>.</p>
<p>If you work in breach of your visa conditions, not only will your status be in jeopardy (you may face deportation, denial of entry next time, etc.) but your employer will also face a hefty fine.</p>
<p>The credit crunch, however, has caused many businesses to lose profit and go broke. Unemployment in 2008 reached its highest since the economic downturn of the early 1990s.</p>

<p>In general the UK is a safe place to visit; you won't go far wrong heeding the <a href="/wiki/Stay_safe" title="Stay safe">general advice</a> and the advice for <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>.</p>
<p>In any <b>emergency</b> call <b>999</b> or <b>112</b> (free of charge from any phone, including mobiles) and ask for Ambulance, Fire and Rescue Service, Police, Coast Guard or Mountain And Cave Rescue when connected. Unlike many other countries, the United Kingdom does not have different numbers for different emergency services.</p>
<p>In a non-emergency situation in <b><a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a></b> and <b><a href="/wiki/Wales" title="Wales">Wales</a></b> you can call <b>101</b> to report crime and concerns to the local Police that do not require an emergency response. A similar service is available in some parts of England at <b>111</b> for health issues that do not require urgent A&amp;E admission, and will be rolled out throughout the country during 2013.</p>
<p>Late at night it is not uncommon to find rowdy groups of drunk people, especially young men, on the street, but unless you go out of your way to provoke trouble you are unlikely to experience any problems. The police have fairly wide ranging powers to fine or arrest people who are causing a disturbance, and although they can be heavier-handed in major cities they are generally tolerant. Drinking alcohol in public (except outside a bar or pub) is not permitted in some towns and areas of cities.</p>
<p>Jaywalking is not considered an offence, but always try to cross at designated pedestrian crossings. Most operate a "Push the button and wait for the green man" system, but some Zebra Crossings are still to be found - identified by white stripes on the road and yellow flashing spherical lights - pedestrians have right of way but it is advisable to make eye contact with the driver before stepping into the road.</p>
<p>If you are bringing or hiring a car, be sure to lock the doors if you leave your car, and always park in a busy, well-lit area. Don't leave valuables on display in a parked car - satellite navigation systems are a particular target.</p>
<p>The age of both heterosexual and homosexual consent is 16 throughout the United Kingdom. Teenagers are generally seen as still children (except those 18 or over, but <b>always ask for proof of age, e.g. passport to prove someone's age, just to be safe.</b>) and you could be termed a paedophile and treated as such. Homosexuality is generally accepted among people throughout the whole country.</p>
<p>Racism is not common in the UK, and racially motivated violence is very rare. The main concern for Britons isn't racism; the government strongly encourages the notion of a multi-cultural society, but recent high levels of immigration have been of debate. However, the UK is generally regarded by its own immigrant population as being among the most liberal and tolerant of European countries in this respect, but obviously there will be some people who are exceptions. Most Britons will go out of their way to make tourists and immigrants feel welcome and it's not uncommon for police to impose harsh punishments on any form of racial abuse - physical or verbal.</p>

<p>On the whole, British police officers tend to be professional and trustworthy, and are generally less aggressive than law enforcement agencies in many other developed nations. However, this does not mean they are lenient. With local exceptions, such as airports and nuclear power plants, the vast majority of British police officers <b>do not carry firearms</b> on standard patrol.</p>
<p>Most officers will only speak English and you will be made to speak to an interpreter over police radio or will do so at a police station if you can't understand questioning in English. You have the legal right to silence when arrested.</p>
<p>Police officers in Great Britain wear dark blue uniforms. Police officers in Northern Ireland wear dark green uniforms and - unlike most of their colleagues in Great Britain - are always armed with a Glock semi-automatic pistol and sometimes larger weapons.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Illegal_drugs">Illegal drugs</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=92" title="Edit section: Illegal drugs">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>All illegal drugs in the United Kingdom are classified under 'A', 'B' or 'C'. Class A drugs are typically regarded as the most dangerous (not always the case) and attract the most severe penalties (e.g. prison time), especially for supplying. Class C are generally regarded as the least harmful (again not always the case) and thus attract lesser penalties (e.g. fines). Remember: <b>all of these drugs are equally illegal</b> and you can still be arrested for possession, supplying or using regardless of the class; the classes are used to determine policing priorities and penalties.</p>
<p>Class A drugs include ecstasy (MDMA), LSD, heroin and cocaine; penalties will mean arrest and possibly jail even for possession. Magic mushrooms were previously legal because of technicalities in the law, but are now class A.</p>
<p>Cannabis is now a 'Class B' drug. A first offence for possession will usually result in a formal warning, or an on-the-spot fine. This does not apply to other Class B drugs, such as speed. Subsequent offences may result in arrest.</p>
<p>Examples of Class C include ketamine, some steroids, some prescription drugs such as Valium (legal if they are prescribed for you), GHB, and some tranquillisers. As of 2013, the British Government is planning to make Khat a Class C drug.</p>
<p>Prescribed drugs may sometimes require a letter from a doctor to be imported. This applies where the drug is a Controlled Drug (A,B or C) in the UK.</p>
<p>Drug use is a growing concern for authorities, with some of the highest levels in Europe. Cannabis and ecstasy are both very widely available and you could even be offered it if you are in the right location such as certain markets and clubs.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Prostitution">Prostitution</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=93" title="Edit section: Prostitution">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Although technically the act of prostitution is not in itself illegal in the UK, many laws criminalise activities associated with it.</p>
<p>Brothels of any kind are illegal under the 1956 Sexual Offences Act, and it's against the law to loiter or solicit sex on the street. 'Kerb-crawling' (driving close to a pavement in order to ask prostitutes for sex) is also banned, and is actively monitored for by police patrols in many towns and cities across the country.</p>
<p>It should be noted that although exchanging money for sex is not in itself prohibited, many legal grey-areas do exist in this department, and the attitude towards the trade is generally not as liberal as in many other European countries.</p>
<p>In larger cities, Police have in recent years begun crackdowns against organised gangs that are using trafficked women in prostitution rackets. Police take a very dim view of such activity, and if you are caught in the premises of such gangs, you will at the very least be thoroughly questioned by police.</p>

<p>In an emergency, telephone <b>999</b> or <b>112</b>, or go directly to the nearest <b>Accident &amp; Emergency</b> (or <b>Emergency Department</b>). Emergencies will be dealt with immediately and before any question of remuneration is even contemplated.</p>
<p>When calling 999 (112) do not be upset if you are asked questions about the emergency. In the UK, Emergency Medical response is prioritised on a clinical basis, and the operator/dispatcher uses these questions to ensure appropriate personnel or equipment are sent. For advice on non-emergency medical problems, you can ring the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/">24-hour NHS Direct</a> service on 0845 4647 (<i>NHS 24</i> in Scotland on 08454 242424)</p>
<p>Emergencies can be dealt with under the NHS (National Health Service) at any hospital with a <b>Casualty</b> or <b>A &amp; E</b> (Accident &amp; Emergency) department. At A&amp;E be prepared to wait for up to 4 hours to be seen to if the medical complaint is not serious, depending on the time of day/night. The longest waiting times usually occur on Friday and Saturday nights. Walk-in centres also provide treatment for less urgent conditions on a first come first served basis. They are open to residents and foreign nationals.</p>
<p>All treatment at an NHS hospital or doctor is free to residents of the UK. All emergency treatment is free, regardless of citizenship or immigration status. As a result, an EHIC card is in fact not necessary (though advised for EU travel in general), as the UK is possibly one of the only countries to provide free emergency treatment without question or identity verification. This also applies to tourists, both from the EU and outside.</p>
<p>For advice on minor ailments and medicines, you can ask a pharmacist (there are many high-street chemists, and to practise legally all pharmacists must be registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) which involves a university degree and other exams and training). Notable pharmacy chains include Boots and Lloyds, and many supermarkets also have pharmacists. It is worth noting that the medicine trade is strictly controlled and many medicines available to purchase from a pharmacy in other countries e.g.: antibiotics can only be provided on production of a prescription written by an authorised medical professional.</p>
<p>Sexually Transmitted Diseases are spreading between young people, so make sure you practise safe sex. There are around 50,000 <a href="/wiki/HIV" title="HIV" class="mw-redirect">HIV</a> victims living in the UK. Chlamydia is common enough to warrant public health screening of young people. Condoms are available in toilets, pharmacies, and supermarkets. They are also available free from some NHS sexual health clinics (known as GUM clinics), which also provide free STI testing and treatment, even if you are not eligible for other NHS services.</p>
<p>Tap water is safe to drink everywhere, unless otherwise stated. Non drinking water sources are typically marked in an obvious manner.</p>

<p>The UK's time zone is GMT+0, but during the 'summer' (March-October) the clocks are one hour ahead (British Summer Time.)</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Electrical_systems" title="Electrical systems">electricity supply</a> runs at <b>230V, 50 Hz AC</b>. Visitors from countries such as the US and Canada, where the voltage supply runs at 110V 60 Hz, may need a voltage converter (which can be picked up in most specialist electronic shops). Many appliances needed whilst travelling (such as laptop chargers, shavers and the like) are designed to run off both voltages, however check on the label before setting off.</p>
<p>British plugs and sockets, made to the British Standard 1363, have three flat, rectangular pins which form a triangle. These sockets are the same used in Ireland, Cyprus, Malta and several other former British colonies. It is possible to force a thin Europlug (with no earth pins) into the socket, however this is not recommended for obvious reasons. Most shops will sell plug adapters, but don't buy them from un-reputable sources. Using plug adapters from these sources carries the risk of fire or electrocution. There is also a 2 pin style shaver socket (BS 4573).</p>
<p>Power connectors for outdoor use (most likely encounter as a caravan hookup), are based on a European wide standard(IEC 60309), with the relevant type for UK mains voltage being 'blue' in colour.</p>
<p>UK uses a PAL based system for TV and video equipment, although this is unlikely to be a concern unless you are bringing specific 'foreign' equipment with you. If you needing a specific video format when shopping, ask the shop or vendor concerned.</p>
<p>Note that during the <b>Christmas</b> and <b>New Year</b> holiday period much of the country shuts down. During the week leading up to Christmas people will travel to their hometowns to visit their family, meaning that the motorway traffic can be very heavy and trains are much more crowded. Also, many people rush to shopping areas to stock up on food and drink and last-minute gifts. On Christmas Day, Boxing Day (Dec 26th) and New Year's Day most businesses will close (including supermarkets and most restaurants and bars) although major hotels remain open. If you need to purchase food, drink or cigarettes on these days then most petrol (gas) station convenience stores will still be open but almost everything else is closed, and on Christmas Day itself even many of these are closed. Many large shops are open (and extremely busy) on Boxing Day. If you don't have a car then avoid travelling on these days as the only available transport in many areas is taxis, which will charge up to three times the regular price. If you have a car then it is much better as roads are almost empty on Christmas Day and parking is often free - however many petrol stations are closed on Christmas Day (except those at Motorway Service Stations, which must be open by law) so plan your journey carefully if you will need to refuel. In many areas, bus and train services finish much earlier than usual on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve, and do not run on Christmas Day or Boxing Day. Buses also tend not to run on New Years Day, outside of major cities. During the week between Christmas and New Year, many transport services operate revised schedules and it is advisable to check with operators.</p>

<p>It's acceptable to address someone by their first name in most social situations. First names are sometimes avoided among strangers to avoid seeming overly familiar. In very formal or business situations first names are not commonly used until people are better acquainted. The best strategy is to use what they introduced themselves with. Officials, however, (like policemen or doctors) will invaribly call you by your title and surname, for example "Mr Smith".</p>
<p>The British can be extremely indirect when requesting things from people they do not know. It is common for Britons to "ask around" questions when requesting something: for example, one would be more likely to say something along the lines of "Where can I find the changing room?" when in a clothes shop, rather than "Where's the changing room?". Although asking questions directly is quite common, it can sometimes be seen as overly abrupt or even rude.</p>
<p>Similarly, saying 'What?' when not understanding something can be considered rude around authority figures or people you don't know, so 'Pardon?' or 'Sorry?' is more appropriate to use in situations with a stranger or a superior. British people apologise a lot, even when there is absolutely no need to do so. For example, if someone trod on someone else's toe by accident, <i>both</i> people would normally apologise. This is just a British thing to do, and dwelling on it (e.g. "What are you sorry about?") will mark you out as a foreigner. Often a British person will request something or start a conversation with 'sorry'. It isn't because they feel sorry, but it is rather used instead of "excuse me" or "pardon".</p>
<p>Allow some <b>personal space</b> between you and others in queues and elsewhere. You will usually find this in such places as cinemas. Generally, unless people know each other, you will find they will usually choose to fill up every row of seating and keep as much distance of possible until there is a requirement to sit directly next to each other. Exceptions are in very crowded situations where this is impossible, like on the Tube.</p>
<p>Greetings are dependent upon the situation. In anything but a business situation, a verbal greeting (such as 'hello (name)!') will suffice. Younger people will usually say 'Hi,' 'Hiya,' or 'Hey' though the latter is also used to attract attention and should not be used to address a stranger as it would be considered impolite. Another British greeting (frequently used by younger people) is 'You all right?' or 'All right?' (sometimes abbreviated to "A' right" in northern England), which is basically a combination of 'Hello' and 'How are you?'. This term can be confusing to foreigners, but it can be easily replied to with either a greeting back (which is far more common) or stating how you feel (usually something short like 'I'm fine, you?').</p>
<p>A greeting may sometimes be accompanied by a kiss on the cheek or less commonly a hug. Etiquette for a hug is somewhat complicated, so the best advice is to accept a hug (regardless of the gender offering it) if it is offered, otherwise a handshake is appropriate. In a formal situation or an initial greeting between two strangers, a handshake is the done thing, this should be of an appropriate firmness (generally moderate firmness).</p>
<p>For more details on unwritten rules concerning greetings, addressing others, smalltalk etc. you may check <i>Watching the English: The Hidden Rules of English Behaviour</i> by Kate Fox.</p>
<p>The Scottish are Scottish, the Welsh are Welsh, and the English are English. Referring to all of them as "English" can offend. Remember, too, most Northern Ireland Unionists would not want to be called Irish, however. By contrast, most of the Nationalists in Northern Ireland will identify as Irish and register accordingly as Irish citizens and carry Irish passports, which all people born in Northern Ireland are entitled to do if they wish. You may also find that even though all the people of the United Kingdom are legally classed as British, people often prefer to be referred to based upon which country in the United Kingdom they were born in, rather than using the collective term British. It is also common to meet someone who might say " I am half Welsh, half-English" or "my parents are Scottish and I am English".</p>
<p>One should avoid referring to the Falkland Islands as being Argentine because it is quite a sensitive issue to some: over 250 British soldiers died fighting to defend the islands from Argentine control in the early 1980s. As the war was won by the British, the Falklands remain a British Overseas Territory to this day. To a lesser extent, the same advice applies when talking about Gibraltar, as Spain claim it as their own.</p>
<p>While doing the V sign with the <b>palm facing outward</b> is taken to indicate either "peace" or "victory" by many Britons, doing the <b>reverse</b> where the palm faces inward is considered to be an offensive gesture, equivalent to raising the middle finger.</p>
<p>Same-sex displays of affection will not likely cause upset or offence apart from some areas such as the rural towns like the Yorkshire valleys and rural Lincolnshire, and in rougher parts of many cities. Cities and towns with larger gay populations include <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>, <a href="/wiki/Birmingham" title="Birmingham" class="mw-redirect">Birmingham</a>, <a href="/wiki/Manchester" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>, <a href="/wiki/Brighton_(England)" title="Brighton (England)">Brighton</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bournemouth" title="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> and <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>. Cities such as Brighton host pride festivals each year. Civil partnerships have been legal since 2005. However, someone looking to start a fight may decide to treat this as a pretext. Try to avoid eye contact with drunken men in city centres at night, especially if they are in a large group. It is also important to note, if in <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, same-sex displays and activities are rarely shown, outside <a href="/wiki/Belfast" title="Belfast">Belfast</a>, where many will still hold Conservative values. Keeping in mind, while in <a href="/wiki/Belfast" title="Belfast">Belfast</a> some areas are safer than others in showing affection. Whilst 'cross-dressing' is not illegal in the UK, it is usually advised to be modest in the choice of outfit, unless you have prior knowledge of local standards.</p>
<p>Urinating in public is now illegal, if you're caught urinating, you'll be given a telling off by the police, made to pay an £80 fine, and, at some areas, be made to clean up your own urine with a mop and disinfectant, which can be embarrassing to offenders. In addition, 'indecent exposure' (defined as exposure of the genitals with the intent to shock people who do not want to see them) is treated as a sexual offence.</p>

A red telephone box, which is now a symbol of Britain despite there being comparatively few on the streets today.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In case of emergency, call <b>999</b> or <b>112</b> from any phone. Such calls are free and will be answered by an emergency services operator who will ask you for your location, and the service(s) you need (police, fire, ambulance, coastguard or mountain rescue). You can call this number from any mobile telephone as well, even if you do not have roaming. As in all other countries, it is a serious crime to call this number without due cause, the semi official criteria being, an immediate serious threat to life or safety. In making an emergency call, give as much information about both your location (and that of the incident needing attention) as possible, official call boxes will typically have location plate giving this, but a street name or building name can also be given.(This location information is needed as 999 response is handled by a central dispatcher.). If asked further questions be prepared to give as much information as you can, as this helps the operator(dispatcher) determine an appropriate response.(Note: Emergency medical response in the UK is prioritised on a clinical basis, and the questions the operator/dispatcher asks are to determine this)</p>
<p>Non-urgent calls to the police should be made on <b>101</b> and calls for non-urgent medical services on <b>111</b>. Non Urgent medical advice can also be obtained from NHS Direct (0845} 4647.</p>
<p>Directory enquiries (number lookup) are provided by a number of operators, 118 500 being the British Telecom service, with other operators like 118 118 providing additional services such as 'Business Lookup' and events information. Unlike other countries these services cannot perform reverse lookups(name from number).</p>
<p>The UK's country code is <b>44</b>. When calling the UK from overseas, dial your international access code (00 from most of Europe, 011 from the US and Canada or '+' from any mobile phone) followed by the UK area code and subscriber number. If the number you are calling is shown with a leading 0 at the beginning of the area code, the 0 must be omitted when calling from overseas. To phone another country from the UK, dial 00 followed by the overseas country code, area code and subscriber number.</p>
<p>When calling a UK landline number from any other UK number, dial the area code (beginning with the leading 0) and the subscriber number. If calling from a landline to another landline within the same area code the area code can usually be omitted, except in the Bournemouth and Poole area in the south of England where the area code (01202) is always required.</p>
<p>For calls to UK mobile telephones from anywhere within the UK all of the digits have to be dialled by all callers.</p>
<p>When the building you're in has its own internal phone system, the number for an outside line is "9" (not "0", as in many other countries, which in the UK usually connects you to the reception desk).</p>
<p>Area codes in the UK do not have a set pattern, London numbers are typically 020 (with 0208 and 0207 replacing the former 0181 and 0171 area codes.).</p>
<p>Payphones are widely available, especially in stations, airports, etc. They are also found on the streets in phone boxes, most notably the red ones, but there are different designs of phone box. Payphones usually take cash (minimum 40p - BT, although some private payphones may charge more); change is not given, but you can choose to continue your money on to the next call. Some newer payphones accept credit and debit cards and may even allow you to send emails and surf the web. Phonecards have been largely phased out, though various pre-paid phonecards can be purchased from newsagents for cheap international calls. Some BT payphones now accept Euros.</p>
<p>A simpler and often cheaper alternative for international calls is to use a direct-dial service. These can offer reduced call rates over the standard providers when called from a landline, and don't require you to purchase a card or sign up for an account. You simply dial an access number (e.g. 0844 or 0871 prefix) and the revenue-share element of the call price pays for the onward international part of the call.</p>
<p>Whether you are calling someone who is inside or outside the UK, it may be important to find out if the phone number being called corresponds to a landline or mobile phone as most operators have different rates for both modes within a particular country.</p>
<p>Mobile phones are heavily used. The main networks are <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.t-mobile.co.uk/">T-Mobile</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.vodafone.co.uk/">Vodafone</a>, [ Orangehttp://www.orange.co.uk/], 3 <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.three.co.uk/">[89]</a> and O2 <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.o2.co.uk/">[90]</a>, and all have use of 3G services as well as GPRS (excluding 3). GPRS and 3G data services are available, usually priced per megabyte. GPRS (Voice, Text, Basic Internet) coverage is very well developed, covering 99% of the population, 3G (MMS, Video, Internet etc.) coverage is also very good in the UK (dependent on network), however it may lack in rural areas. T-Mobile and Orange are both run by Everything Everywhere <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://everythingeverywhere.com/">[91]</a>, and therefore these two networks share each others' signal.</p>
<p>There is no charge for calls that you receive on your handset except for those roaming; charges are only for calls that you initiate.</p>
<p>Pay as you go (prepaid) plans are available. Credit the phone with a top-up card or cash payment via a top-up terminal; there is no contract and no bills. Some operators also offer packages which mix texts, phone calls and/or data at affordable rates. These packages can come with your initial top-up or deducted from your balance.</p>
<p>If you have an unlocked GSM-compatible handset (most dual- and tri-band phones are GSM-compatible) you can purchase a SIM card from several electrical or phone outlets, in supermarkets, or online. Be aware prices do vary considerably ? from £5 (with £10 call credit) from Tesco online (available in Tesco supermarkets) to £30 (with £2.50 credit) from Vodafone (available at all mobile phone shops). Often bargain handset-and-SIM deals can be found, if you don't have an unlocked handset - at the time of writing you can get a very basic mobile with SIM for £18 from Tesco, though note that this will be a locked phone and won't work with other SIM cards.</p>
<p>The UK has extensive mobile phone coverage - 99% of the UK mainland is covered. Many towns and cities have 3G coverage as well.</p>
<p>Costs for calls can vary significantly depending on when you call, where from and where to. Calls from hotel rooms can be spectacularly expensive because of the hotel surcharges; check before you use and consider using the lobby payphones instead. Calls from payphones and wired, or landline, phones to mobile phones can be expensive too; if you have the choice call the other party's landline. Beware of premium rate calls, which can be very expensive. Text messaging from mobiles costs around 10 pence per message and picture or MMS messages cost around 45 pence (20 pence on some networks).</p>
<p>Calls between landlines are usually charged at a single national rate. Some providers charge a higher rate to Jersey, Guernsey, Sark and the Isle of Man.</p>
<p>If the originating and destination area codes are the same then the area code can be omitted when calling from a landline. Note that local calls are not generally free unless someone you may be staying with has a particular contract with their landline provider. The following table relates the first few digits dialled to call types, so you can avoid some of the pitfalls above:</p>

</tr></table><p>Where a call is chargeable, calling from a mobile telephone will usually cost more than calling the same number from a landline.</p>
<p>* These freephone charges can be avoided by using landline dial-around services like 0800Buster <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.0800buster.co.uk/">[92]</a>.</p>

<p>Internet cafés can be found in cities and towns; check the city pages for details. All UK public libraries provide access, often branded as "People's Network", usually at no or little charge, though time is rationed. Some hotels/hostels also offer internet access either via their cable TV system or WiFi, although the prices are quite steep (www.spectrumineractive.co.uk provide the Scottish YHA with a network of broadband and WiFi-capable Internet terminals).</p>
<p>A number of ISPs charge nothing for Internet access by telephone modem - they get their payment from the phone company; local call costs are time-related. Examples are GoNuts4Free <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.Gonuts4Free.com/">[93]</a>, DialUKT <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.DialUKT.com/">[94]</a>.</p>
<p>There are some Wi-Fi hotspots, although intentionally publicly available wireless is not yet widespread outside central London. Most McDonald's restaurants in the UK now offer free WiFi. Many coffee shops offer paid Wi-Fi. The most you should pay for Wi-Fi access across the UK is £1 for half an hour. Many chain cafés will charge more for no extra value.</p>
<p>Most of the UK is covered by UMTS/HSDPA 3G coverage, giving download speeds up to 7.2Mbit/s, and GPRS coverage is extensive. 3G data services should roam seamlessly onto the UK networks, or you can purchase a pay-as-you-go SIM card for which credit can be purchased in the same way as for mobile phones. For example T-Mobile stores will give you a free SIM-card on which you can load any amount you want. Access cost £2 per day, £7 per week.</p>

<p>The Royal Mail has a long history. Postboxes are still the traditional red colour (although there are green and gold Victorian "Penfold" boxes retained in some areas and an historically important blue box in <a href="/wiki/Windsor_and_Eton" title="Windsor and Eton">Windsor</a>). Mail can also be posted at post offices.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Postal_rates">Postal rates</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=101" title="Edit section: Postal rates">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>The Royal Mail has introduced a new system where post within the UK is priced on size <b>and</b> weight. You can find size charts at all post offices but bear this in mind when sending a larger envelope, parcel or packet.</p>
<p>Postage stamps for within the UK (Channel Islands and Isle of Man included) cost <b>50p</b>/<b>60p</b> (domestic 1st/2nd class for envelopes up to C5 size which are less than 5mm thick and less than 100g).</p>
<p>Postage stamps for international mail cost:</p>
<p>Surface mail: <b>78p</b> (worldwide postcards and letters up to 20g, available outside Europe only)</p>
<p>Airmail: <b>88p</b> (Europe &amp; worldwide postcards), <b>88p</b> (Europe letters up to 20g), <b>£1.28</b> (worldwide letters up to 20g).</p>
<p>Stamps can be bought at supermarkets, newsagents and tourist shops. Domestic first-class mail can usually be expected to arrive the following day; second-class mail may take several days. Signage on all postboxes displays the final collection time at that location (typically about 5:30PM on weekdays and noon on Saturdays), as well as details of later weeknight collections that are available in many areas from a central postbox or sorting office. Deliveries are likewise made six mornings per week, Monday to Saturday. There is generally no post on Sundays or Public Holidays.</p>
<p>If you wish to send something heavy, or want to send a larger letter or packet within the UK, then you will have to get it weighed and/or measured at the post office. The staff at post offices are very helpful, but avoid the lunchtime rush at around 12-1.30PM when there is often a long queue and 30+ minute waiting times.</p>
<p>One interesting side-pursuit is to look at when the postboxes were built since some can be very old. The 'R' stands for Rex/Regina and the first letter the initial of the monarch reinging when it was built. E.g. A postbox built after 1952 would have the initials 'E II R'. Finding a box with the initials 'VR' (Queen Victoria, pre-1901) is possible, but quite a feat.</p>
